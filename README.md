| **[Attention Enhanced Entity Recommendation for Intelligent Monitoring in Cloud Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20640v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes, and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it 4.5 out of 5.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Temporal Graph of Bitcoin Transactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20028v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08} billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and \num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking.

| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoDial: Interpretable Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems Through Dialogue Flow Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02264v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems that generalize across different tasks remains a challenging problem. Data-driven approaches often struggle to transfer effectively to unseen tasks. While recent schema-based TOD frameworks improve generalization by decoupling task logic from language understanding, their reliance on neural or generative models often obscures how task schemas influence behaviour and hence impair interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), which converts a TOD task schema, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, to programmatic LLM guardrailing code, such as NVIDIA's Colang, enabling interpretable and efficient alignment of dialogue policies during inference. We introduce two paradigms, $\text{CoDial}_{\text{free}}$ and $\text{CoDial}_{\text{structured}}$ for generating LLM guardrails, and propose a feedback mechanism that integrates human feedback to iteratively improve the generated code. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the widely used STAR dataset and is on par with SOTA on the MultiWOZ dataset, while also providing interpretability. We additionally demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of LLMs in high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Heterogeneous Continual Graph Learning via Meta-Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17458v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[MGTS-Net: Exploring Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16350v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHAN: Object-Level Privacy Detection via Inference on Scene Heterogeneous Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09172v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.</p></details> | <details><summary>I wou...</summary><p>I would like to formally request the withdrawal of my manuscript from arXiv.

| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Causal Disentanglement Learning for Accurate Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11084v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 Figures, |
| **[D3MAS: Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute for Enhanced Knowledge Sharing in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10585v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy by 46\% on average.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative Reasoning Recommendation via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20815v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals, combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation, which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization (SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Order of Recommendation Matters: Structured Exploration for Improving the Fairness of Content Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20698v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms provide millions of professional content creators with sustainable incomes. Their income is largely influenced by their number of views and followers, which in turn depends on the platform's recommender system (RS). So, as with regular jobs, it is important to ensure that RSs distribute revenue in a fair way. For example, prior work analyzed whether the creators of the highest-quality content would receive the most followers and income. Results showed this is unlikely to be the case, but did not suggest targeted solutions. In this work, we first use theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic datasets to understand the system better and find interventions that improve fairness for creators. We find that the use of ordered pairwise comparison overcomes the cold start problem for a new set of items and greatly increases the chance of achieving fair outcomes for all content creators. Importantly, it also maintains user satisfaction. We also test the intervention on the MovieLens dataset and investigate its effectiveness on platforms with interaction histories that are currently unfair for content creators. These experiments reveal that the intervention improves fairness when deployed at early stages of the platform, but the effect decreases as the strength of pre-existing bias increases. Altogether, we find that the ordered pairwise comparison approach might offer a plausible alternative for both new and existing platforms to implement.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Reflect: Cross-Reflection Prompting for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15172v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we identify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and recommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal prompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also introduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image content using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone, achieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive performance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rotate Both Ways: Time-and-Order RoPE for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20455v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models, predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly foundation for generative recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stratification in Randomised Clinical Trials for Rare Diseases and Analysis of Covariance: Some Simple Theory and Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06760v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A simple device for balancing for a continuous covariate in clinical trials is to stratify by whether the covariate is above or below some target value, typically the predicted median. This raises an issue as to which model should be used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$. Should one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both or neither? When a covariate is added to a linear model there are three consequences for inference: 1) the mean square error effect, 2) the variance inflation factor and 3) second order precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three factors separately, even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters. We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance inflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model. We also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between the outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that the continuous covariate should always be in the model but that, depending on circumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator also.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[LEGO: A Lightweight and Efficient Multiple-Attribute Unlearning Framework for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20327v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/anonymifish/lego-rec-multiple-attribute-unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Learning to Hash techniques have emerged as a promising solution to these issues by encoding high-dimensional data into compact hash codes. As a result, hashing-based recommendation methods (HashRec) have garnered growing attention for enabling large-scale and efficient recommendation services. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art HashRec algorithms. Specifically, we begin by introducing the common two-tower architecture used in the recall stage and by detailing two predominant hash search strategies. Then, we categorize existing works into a three-tier taxonomy based on: (i) learning objectives, (ii) optimization strategies, and (iii) recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we summarize widely adopted evaluation metrics for assessing both the effectiveness and efficiency of HashRec algorithms. Finally, we discuss current limitations in the field and outline promising directions for future research. We index these HashRec methods at the repository \href{https://github.com/Luo-Fangyuan/HashRec}{https://github.com/Luo-Fangyuan/HashRec}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Dynamic Embedding Size Search for Streaming Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15411v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems typically represent users and items by learning their embeddings, which are usually set to uniform dimensions and dominate the model parameters. However, real-world recommender systems often operate in streaming recommendation scenarios, where the number of users and items continues to grow, leading to substantial storage resource consumption for these embeddings. Although a few methods attempt to mitigate this by employing embedding size search strategies to assign different embedding dimensions in streaming recommendations, they assume that the embedding size grows with the frequency of users/items, which eventually still exceeds the predefined memory budget over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn Scalable Lightweight Embeddings for streaming recommendation, called SCALL, which can adaptively adjust the embedding sizes of users/items within a given memory budget over time. Specifically, we propose to sample embedding sizes from a probabilistic distribution, with the guarantee to meet any predefined memory budget. By fixing the memory budget, the proposed embedding size sampling strategy can increase and decrease the embedding sizes in accordance to the frequency of the corresponding users or items. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning-based search paradigm that models each state with mean pooling to keep the length of the state vectors fixed, invariant to the changing number of users and items. As a result, the proposed method can provide embedding sizes to unseen users and items. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on two public datasets affirm the advantageous effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CIKM 2024 Code is available at https://github.com/qykcq/Scalable-Dynamic-Embedding-Size-Search-for-Streaming-Recommendation</p></details> |
| **[Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14884v7)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learning based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e., embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-based action formulation and engaging set representation learning, we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular recommender models under different memory budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM 2024.

| **[Continuous Input Embedding Size Search For Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03501v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent factor models are the most popular backbones for today's recommender systems owing to their prominent performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as real-valued embedding vectors for pairwise similarity computation, and all embeddings are traditionally restricted to a uniform size that is relatively large (e.g., 256-dimensional). With the exponentially expanding user base and item catalog in contemporary e-commerce, this design is admittedly becoming memory-inefficient. To facilitate lightweight recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently opened up opportunities for identifying varying embedding sizes for different users/items. However, challenged by search efficiency and learning an optimal RL policy, existing RL-based methods are restricted to highly discrete, predefined embedding size choices. This leads to a largely overlooked potential of introducing finer granularity into embedding sizes to obtain better recommendation effectiveness under a given memory budget. In this paper, we propose continuous input embedding size search (CIESS), a novel RL-based method that operates on a continuous search space with arbitrary embedding sizes to choose from. In CIESS, we further present an innovative random walk-based exploration strategy to allow the RL policy to efficiently explore more candidate embedding sizes and converge to a better decision. CIESS is also model-agnostic and hence generalizable to a variety of latent factor RSs, whilst experiments on two real-world datasets have shown state-of-the-art performance of CIESS under different memory budgets when paired with three popular recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR'23.

As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates. To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025.

Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this challenge, we study a two-stage ``recommend-to-match" problem under stochastic supplier rejections, where each demand is initially recommended to multiple potential suppliers prior to final matching decisions. We formulate a stochastic optimization model that explicitly captures uncertain supplier acceptance behavior. We show that an exact mixed-integer linear formulation is obtainable for the special case with homogeneous and independent acceptance responses, but the general problem does not admit an efficient formulation. Particularly, our analysis reveals that deterministic linear approximation methods can perform arbitrarily poorly in such settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approximation approach based on mixed-integer exponential cone programming (MIECP) and establish its parametric performance guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world freight data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our MIECP-based solution achieves near-optimal matching performance while reducing computation time by over 90% compared to benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embedding in Recommender Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18608v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that convert the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors, which can enhance the recommendation performance. Embedding techniques have revolutionized the capture of complex entity relationships, generating significant research interest. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in recommender system embedding techniques. We examine centralized embedding approaches across matrix, sequential, and graph structures. In matrix-based scenarios, collaborative filtering generates embeddings that effectively model user-item preferences, particularly in sparse data environments. For sequential data, we explore various approaches including recurrent neural networks and self-supervised methods such as contrastive and generative learning. In graph-structured contexts, we analyze techniques like node2vec that leverage network relationships, along with applicable self-supervised methods. Our survey addresses critical scalability challenges in embedding methods and explores innovative directions in recommender systems. We introduce emerging approaches, including AutoML, hashing techniques, and quantization methods, to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we examine the promising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding enhancement. Through detailed discussion of various architectures and methodologies, this survey aims to provide a thorough overview of state-of-the-art embedding techniques in recommender systems, while highlighting key challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 47 pages |
| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scalable LinUCB: Low-Rank Design Matrix Updates for Recommenders with Large Action Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19349v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank $r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v4)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000 rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine adapted to specific patient characteristics.</p></details> |  |

Various types of explainable recommender systems have been proposed including explainable graph-based recommender systems. This review paper discusses state-of-the-art approaches of these systems and categorizes them based on three aspects: learning methods, explaining methods, and explanation types. It also explores the commonly used datasets, explainability evaluation methods, and future directions of this research area.

| **[Evaluating LLM-Based Mobile App Recommendations: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Enhancing Hotel Recommendations with AI: LLM-Based Review Summarization and Query-Driven Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18277v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing number of data a booking platform such as Booking.com and AirBnB offers make it challenging for interested parties to browse through the available accommodations and analyze reviews in an efficient way. Efforts have been made from the booking platform providers to utilize recommender systems in an effort to enable the user to filter the results by factors such as stars, amenities, cost but most valuable insights can be provided by the unstructured text-based reviews. Going through these reviews one-by-one requires a substantial amount of time to be devoted while a respectable percentage of the reviews won't provide to the user what they are actually looking for. This research publication explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance short rental apartments recommendations by summarizing and mining key insights from user reviews. The web application presented in this paper, named "instaGuide", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews from a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the reviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an effort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria. During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment, improving the overall decision-making procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |

We argue for a shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab (AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation, literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation, manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems), we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata; and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the responsible integration of automated research systems.</p></details> |  |

This study examined how six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies. Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases, creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong performance of cost-effective open-source models (Llama: 4.47/5; DeepSeek: 4.25/5) compared to proprietary alternatives (ChatGPT 4: 3.90/5; Claude: 3.46/5) challenges assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained settings. Our findings highlight how computing competency requirements vary widely across Africa and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in education that emphasize contextual relevance</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables.

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 2025</p></details> |

To improve recommender systems, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments to evaluate algorithm updates. We show that commonly adopted difference-in-means estimators can lead to severely biased estimates due to recommender interference, where treated and control creators compete for exposure. This bias can result in incorrect business decisions. To address this, we propose a ``recommender choice model'' that explicitly represents the interference pathway. The approach combines a structural choice framework with neural networks to account for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. Building on this foundation, we develop a debiased estimator using the double machine learning (DML) framework to adjust for errors from nuisance component estimation. We show that the estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal, and we extend the DML theory to handle correlated data, which arise in our context due to overlapped items. We validate our method with a large-scale field experiment on Weixin short-video platform, using a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain an interference-free ground truth. Our results show that the proposed estimator successfully recovers this ground truth, whereas benchmark estimators exhibit substantial bias, and in some cases, yield reversed signs.</p></details> |  |

This paper discusses the consequences of such recommendation on market concentration and inequality. Binary types denoting a statistical majority and minority are noisily revealed through a statistical experiment. The achievable utilities and recommendation shares for the two groups can be analyzed as a Bayesian Persuasion problem. While under arbitrary noise structures, effects on concentration compared to a full-information market are ambiguous, under symmetric noise, concentration increases and consumer welfare becomes more unequal. We define symmetric statistical experiments and analyze persuasion under a restriction to such experiments, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Layout Is the Model: On Action-Item Coupling in Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16804v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g., watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action given item" and (P3) no information leakage. While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens) naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving. Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both accurate and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Responsible Adaptation of Large Language Models for Robust and Equitable Top-k Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04762v3)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional recommendation systems (RSs) are typically optimized to enhance performance metrics uniformly across all training samples, inadvertently overlooking the needs of diverse user populations. The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness to sub-populations due to the varying user properties. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in enhancing RS performance, their practical applicability is hindered by high costs, inference latency, and degraded performance on long user queries. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework designed to promote social good by equitably serving all user groups. By adopting a two-phase approach, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task. We evaluate our hybrid framework by incorporating eight different recommendation algorithms and three different LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness to subpopulations without disproportionately escalating costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.00824</p></details> |

However, research in this area has been persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025) from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems.

However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences. Implementation codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as an EMNLP'25 main paper</p></details> |
| **[Learnable Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07314v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, a crucial challenge is transforming recommendation data into the language space of LLMs through effective item tokenization. Current approaches, such as ID, textual, and codebook-based identifiers, exhibit shortcomings in encoding semantic information, incorporating collaborative signals, or handling code assignment bias. To address these limitations, we propose LETTER (a LEarnable Tokenizer for generaTivE Recommendation), which integrates hierarchical semantics, collaborative signals, and code assignment diversity to satisfy the essential requirements of identifiers. LETTER incorporates Residual Quantized VAE for semantic regularization, a contrastive alignment loss for collaborative regularization, and a diversity loss to mitigate code assignment bias. We instantiate LETTER on two models and propose a ranking-guided generation loss to augment their ranking ability theoretically. Experiments on three datasets validate the superiority of LETTER, advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of LLM-based generative recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Large Language Models as Recommendation Systems with Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15647v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations. The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies. Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose, we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BPL: Bias-adaptive Preference Distillation Learning for Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16076v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via: https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with ID-Content Modality Alignment for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10556v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on the historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal performance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |
| **[MTmixAtt: Integrating Mixture-of-Experts with Multi-Mix Attention for Large-Scale Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15286v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models, WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales, MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by \textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and commercial outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Safe and Human-Aligned Game Conversational Recommendation via Multi-Agent Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20094v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have advanced with large language models, showing strong results in domains like movies. These domains typically involve fixed content and passive consumption, where user preferences can be matched by genre or theme. In contrast, games present distinct challenges: fast-evolving catalogs, interaction-driven preferences (e.g., skill level, mechanics, hardware), and increased risk of unsafe responses in open-ended conversation. We propose MATCHA, a multi-agent framework for CRS that assigns specialized agents for intent parsing, tool-augmented retrieval, multi-LLM ranking with reflection, explanation, and risk control which enabling finer personalization, long-tail coverage, and stronger safety. Evaluated on real user request dataset, MATCHA outperforms six baselines across eight metrics, improving Hit@5 by 20%, reducing popularity bias by 24%, and achieving 97.9% adversarial defense. Human and virtual-judge evaluations confirm improved explanation quality and user alignment.</p></details> | IMCL MAS |
| **[A Simulation Framework for Studying Systemic Effects of Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14857v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Causality Enhancement for Cross-Domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14641v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical value in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[GemiRec: Interest Quantization and Generation for Multi-Interest Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14626v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations: the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then, we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c) Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its practical value in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance. Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some experiments in the paper have not been sufficiently validated, leading to conclusions that lack robustness.

| **[Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03941v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns - stability - and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes - plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity. Although additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.</p></details> |  |

However, current methodologies that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and personalized adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyMiRec: A Hybrid Multi-interest Learning Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13738v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for sequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2025 Accepted</p></details> |

This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages |

This study presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically, we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment. In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by 50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM RecSys 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

| **[TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the TMLR journal</p></details> |
| **[CTRL-Rec: Controlling Recommender Systems With Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12742v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system, they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests, and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time, we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[CiteBART: Learning to Generate Citations for Local Citation Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17534v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local citation recommendation (LCR) suggests a set of papers for a citation placeholder within a given context. The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference.

| **[Causal Inspired Multi Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12325v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases: (i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii) interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12211v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However, applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly across different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we systematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across generation, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm, offering insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

We present FLARKO (Financial Language-model for Asset Recommendation with Knowledge-graph Optimization), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to generate asset recommendations that are both profitable and behaviorally aligned. FLARKO encodes users' transaction histories and asset trends as structured KGs, providing interpretable and controllable context for the LLM. To demonstrate the adaptability of our approach, we develop and evaluate both a centralized architecture (CenFLARKO) and a federated variant (FedFLARKO). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of combining KTO for fine-tuning of LLMs for financial asset recommendation. We also present the first use of structured KGs to ground LLM reasoning over behavioral financial data in a federated learning (FL) setting. Evaluated on the FAR-Trans dataset, FLARKO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines on behavioral alignment and joint profitability, while remaining interpretable and resource-efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12054v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneRec-Think: In-Text Reasoning for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11639v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful generative capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a paradigm shift in recommendation. However, existing generative models (e.g., OneRec) operate as implicit predictors, critically lacking the capacity for explicit and controllable reasoning-a key advantage of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose OneRec-Think, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates dialogue, reasoning, and personalized recommendation. OneRec-Think incorporates: (1) Itemic Alignment: cross-modal Item-Textual Alignment for semantic grounding; (2) Reasoning Activation: Reasoning Scaffolding to activate LLM reasoning within the recommendation context; and (3) Reasoning Enhancement, where we design a recommendation-specific reward function that accounts for the multi-validity nature of user preferences. Experiments across public benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our proposed "Think-Ahead" architecture enables effective industrial deployment on Kuaishou, achieving a 0.159\% gain in APP Stay Time and validating the practical efficacy of the model's explicit reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Inherited Popularity Bias in Cold-Start Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11402v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making predictions on unseen, or 'cold', items. Systems designed to address this challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods, cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases. In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely: because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM RecSys 2025</p></details> |

Existing generative paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact, delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVIGER: Multi-View Variational Integration of Complementary Knowledge for Generative Recommender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) have been widely used in recommender systems to incorporate textual information of items into item IDs, leveraging their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recently, generative recommender systems have utilized the reasoning abilities of LMs to directly generate index tokens for potential items of interest based on the user's interaction history. To inject diverse item knowledge into LMs, prompt templates with detailed task descriptions and various indexing techniques derived from diverse item information have been explored. This paper focuses on the inconsistency in outputs generated by variations in input prompt templates and item index types, even with the same user's interaction history. Our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals that preference knowledge learned from diverse prompt templates and heterogeneous indices differs significantly, indicating a high potential for complementarity. To fully exploit this complementarity and provide consistent performance under varying prompts and item indices, we propose MVIGER, a unified variational framework that models selection among these information sources as a categorical latent variable with a learnable prior. During inference, this prior enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant source or aggregate predictions across multiple sources, thereby ensuring high-quality recommendation across diverse template-index combinations. We validate the effectiveness of MVIGER on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing generative recommender baselines through the effective integration of complementary knowledge.</p></details> |  |

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Poster</p></details> |

However, current research in MSR faces two significant challenges that hinder the field's development: the absence of uniform procedures for multi-scenario dataset processing, thus hindering fair comparisons, and most models being closed-sourced, which complicates comparisons with current SOTA models. Consequently, we introduce our benchmark, \textbf{Scenario-Wise Rec}, which comprises 6 public datasets and 12 benchmark models, along with a training and evaluation pipeline. Additionally, we validated the benchmark using an industrial advertising dataset, reinforcing its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios. We aim for this benchmark to offer researchers valuable insights from prior work, enabling the development of novel models based on our benchmark and thereby fostering a collaborative research ecosystem in MSR.

Diagnosing Language Bias in LLM-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates language bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them. Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model Hyper Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation (HAMUR). Specifically, HAMUR consists of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2023</p></details> |

LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic reasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively modeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in users' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the attention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within the same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking strategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow layers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items, facilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers, HatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture cross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to jointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves significant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art approaches, which aim to minimize changes in product aspects while reversing their recommended decisions according to an aggregated decision boundary score, often lead to factual inaccuracies in explanations. To solve this problem, in this work we propose a novel method of Comparative Counterfactual Explanations for Recommendation (CoCountER). CoCountER creates counterfactual data based on soft swap operations, enabling explanations for recommendations of arbitrary pairs of comparative items. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10564v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user interests in historical interaction sequences. Historical interaction sequences often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise. Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise, limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long-Term User Welfare in Recommender Systems via Creator-Oriented Information Revelation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10511v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the long-term user welfare (e.g., sustained user engagement) has become a central objective of recommender systems (RS). In real-world platforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in shaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the effective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS ecosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that heuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when embedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with the short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established economics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach without relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information from an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can effectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by this idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term Welfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we utilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion) to map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators as the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption of traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information revelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm trained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators. Extensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information revealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.</p></details> |  |

When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix factorization for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of the Web Conference (WWW) 2025 (11 pages)</p></details> |

Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.</p></details> | 41 pages |

Recently, generative reranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model complex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from the "likelihood trap", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as low-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of high-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user engagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative Recommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the likelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture diverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the decoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by implicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we design a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling the model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated on a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily active users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both recommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Structure-Aware Attention and Knowledge Graphs in Explainable Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10109v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper designs and implements an explainable recommendation model that integrates knowledge graphs with structure-aware attention mechanisms. The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10105v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClustRecNet: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Clustering Algorithm Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25289v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.</p></details> |  |

While cross-attention is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300 experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter. We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in multi-modal research.</p></details> | 19 pages |

GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UIST 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at https://github.com/MinmaoWang/HSRL.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias. Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Data Augmentation in Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09129v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms, from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model.

| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that \ourname{} consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WWW 2026.

Building on this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Makes LLMs Effective Sequential Recommenders? A Study on Preference Intensity and Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02261v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet, existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit, neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation. RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15695v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</p></details> |  |

Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.</p></details> |  |

Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models.

We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight; Project page: https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip-2/</p></details> |

Since the model is sensitive to domain shift, unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | MICCAI 2021 |

| **[Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Bottlenecked Semantic Increments in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by contrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of the modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place optimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity. Moreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To address these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\Delta_{ij}$ between text $t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension and absorb noise. We derive $\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor expansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it guides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches for structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\Delta$ through a variational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing stability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

| **[Learning Contrastive Feature Representations for Facial Action Unit Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06165v7)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the Facial Action Unit (AU) detection task, accurately capturing the subtle facial differences between distinct AUs is essential for reliable detection. Additionally, AU detection faces challenges from class imbalance and the presence of noisy or false labels, which undermine detection accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework aimed for AU detection that incorporates both self-supervised and supervised signals, thereby enhancing the learning of discriminative features for accurate AU detection. To tackle the class imbalance issue, we employ a negative sample re-weighting strategy that adjusts the step size of updating parameters for minority and majority class samples. Moreover, to address the challenges posed by noisy and false AU labels, we employ a sampling technique that encompasses three distinct types of positive sample pairs. This enables us to inject self-supervised signals into the supervised signal, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of noisy labels. Our experimental assessments, conducted on five widely-utilized benchmark datasets (BP4D, DISFA, BP4D+, GFT and Aff-Wild2), underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods of AU detection.

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional methods, including maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy, ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach.

| **[Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines. For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness, overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MobiAct: Efficient MAV Action Recognition Using MobileNetV4 with Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19273v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network (ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProCLIP: Progressive Vision-Language Alignment via LLM-based Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18795v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77 tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder, leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training. To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/ProCLIP.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 fiugres |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.

While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

| **[AmorLIP: Efficient Language-Image Pretraining via Amortization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18983v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  |

Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks, including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

| **[Exploring a Unified Vision-Centric Contrastive Alternatives on Multi-Modal Web Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18703v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning.

EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 17 pages total</p></details> |

Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CovMatch: Cross-Covariance Guided Multimodal Dataset Distillation with Trainable Text Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18583v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models. While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, the IQFMs framework effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that the IQFMs framework outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs framework achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures; typos corrected, references added</p></details> |

With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness. Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points. Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a SN journal</p></details> |

Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

Conventional landmark-based methods face a fundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low distinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult stable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the challenge of descriptively identifying a unique "signature" (local point cloud) by leveraging a detectable, high-precision "anchor" (like a pole). To solve this, we propose a novel canonical representation, "Pole-Image," as a hybrid method that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding 3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding environment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image with the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's nature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the "relative geometry" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The key advantage of pole landmarks is that "detection" is extremely easy. This ease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the automatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive pairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes "Contrastive Learning (CL)" applicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly discriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor overcomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The high-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing to map maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, technical report</p></details> |

Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48.

| **[Boosting Graph Robustness Against Backdoor Attacks: An Over-Similarity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01272v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in tasks such as social and transportation networks. However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, raising significant concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, existing defense methods face two main challenges: either the inability to establish a clear distinction between triggers and clean nodes, resulting in the removal of many clean nodes, or the failure to eliminate the impact of triggers, making it challenging to restore the target nodes to their pre-attack state. Through empirical analysis of various existing graph backdoor attacks, we observe that the triggers generated by these methods exhibit over-similarity in both features and structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel graph backdoor defense method SimGuard. We first utilizes a similarity-based metric to detect triggers and then employs contrastive learning to train a backdoor detector that generates embeddings capable of separating triggers from clean nodes, thereby improving detection efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method effectively defends against various graph backdoor attacks while preserving performance on clean nodes. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After discussions with one of the co-authors, it was decided that this version should not be made public at this time.

Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Fusion at Three Tiers: Physics-Driven Data Generation and Vision-Language Guidance for Brain Tumor Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09966v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.</p></details> | 31 pages,3 figures |
| **[Connecting Domains and Contrasting Samples: A Ladder for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16704v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in CLIP via Reconstruction and Alignment of Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16540v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences.

Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA) that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL) selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views, S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |

Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGRouter: Learning to Route Queries to Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23052v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations, exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings, covering open and closed-source LLMs, show that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM and existing routing methods. With an extended score-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints.

Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |
| **[MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</p></details> |  |

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.</p></details> |  |

However, practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data -- let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts.

| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Following the Autoregressive Nature of LLM Embeddings via Compression and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11401v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG.

We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |

Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

| **[QUIDS: Query Intent Description for Exploratory Search via Dual Space Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12400v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In exploratory search, users often submit vague queries to investigate unfamiliar topics, but receive limited feedback about how the search engine understood their input. This leads to a self-reinforcing cycle of mismatched results and trial-and-error reformulation. To address this, we study the task of generating user-facing natural language query intent descriptions that surface what the system likely inferred the query to mean, based on post-retrieval evidence. We propose QUIDS, a method that leverages dual-space contrastive learning to isolate intent-relevant information while suppressing irrelevant content. QUIDS combines a dual-encoder representation space with a disentangling decoder that works together to produce concise and accurate intent descriptions. Enhanced by intent-driven hard negative sampling, the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across ROUGE, BERTScore, and human/LLM evaluations. Our qualitative analysis confirms QUIDS' effectiveness in generating accurate intent descriptions for exploratory search. Our work contributes to improving the interaction between users and search engines by providing feedback to the user in exploratory search settings.

| **[Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[RelTopo: Multi-Level Relational Modeling for Driving Scene Topology Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13553v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.</p></details> |  |
| **[MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ReasoningShield: Safety Detection over Reasoning Traces of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17244v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) leverage transparent reasoning traces, known as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), to break down complex problems into intermediate steps and derive final answers. However, these reasoning traces introduce unique safety challenges: harmful content can be embedded in intermediate steps even when final answers appear benign. Existing moderation tools, designed to handle generated answers, struggle to effectively detect hidden risks within CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce ReasoningShield, a lightweight yet robust framework for moderating CoTs in LRMs. Our key contributions include: (1) formalizing the task of CoT moderation with a multi-level taxonomy of 10 risk categories across 3 safety levels, (2) creating the first CoT moderation benchmark which contains 9.2K pairs of queries and reasoning traces, including a 7K-sample training set annotated via a human-AI framework and a rigorously curated 2.2K human-annotated test set, and (3) developing a two-stage training strategy that combines stepwise risk analysis and contrastive learning to enhance robustness. Experiments show that ReasoningShield achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming task-specific tools like LlamaGuard-4 by 35.6% and general-purpose commercial models like GPT-4o by 15.8% on benchmarks, while also generalizing effectively across diverse reasoning paradigms, tasks, and unseen scenarios.

| **[Contrastive Learning-Based Dependency Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13368v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space. Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC, while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

| **[GRACE: Globally-Seeded Representation-Aware Cluster-Specific Evolution for Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13176v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler pass selection and phase ordering present a significant challenge in achieving optimal program performance, particularly for objectives like code size reduction. Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but often yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all nature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its prohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches promise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen programs. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler auto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE effectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a weighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences and a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass sequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate similarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a coreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to unseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset sequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on seven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an average of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz, while incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[VCTR: A Transformer-Based Model for Non-parallel Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12964v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-parallel voice conversion aims to convert voice from a source domain to a target domain without paired training data. Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have been used for this task, but these models suffer from difficult training and unsatisfactory results. Later, Contrastive Voice Conversion (CVC) was introduced, utilizing a contrastive learning-based approach to address these issues. However, these methods use CNN-based generators, which can capture local semantics but lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies necessary for global semantics. In this paper, we propose VCTR, an efficient method for non-parallel voice conversion that leverages the Hybrid Perception Block (HPB) and Dual Pruned Self-Attention (DPSA) along with a contrastive learning-based adversarial approach. The code can be found in https://github.com/Maharnab-Saikia/VCTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMG-UP: Unsupervised Personalization in Cross-User EMG Gesture Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21589v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-user electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition represents a fundamental challenge in achieving scalable and personalized human-machine interaction within real-world applications. Despite extensive efforts, existing methodologies struggle to generalize effectively across users due to the intrinsic biological variability of EMG signals, resulting from anatomical heterogeneity and diverse task execution styles. To address this limitation, we introduce EMG-UP, a novel and effective framework for Unsupervised Personalization in cross-user gesture recognition. The proposed framework leverages a two-stage adaptation strategy: (1) Sequence-Cross Perspective Contrastive Learning, designed to disentangle robust and user-specific feature representations by capturing intrinsic signal patterns invariant to inter-user variability, and (2) Pseudo-Label-Guided Fine-Tuning, which enables model refinement for individual users without necessitating access to source domain data. Extensive evaluations show that EMG-UP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods by at least 2.0% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown potential for URL analysis tasks, three limitations persist in current implementations: (1) inability to effectively model the non-natural hierarchical structure of URLs, (2) insufficient sensitivity to character-level obfuscation, and (3) lack of mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary network-level signals such as IP addresses-all essential for robust detection. To address these challenges, we propose CURL-IP, an advanced multi-modal detection framework incorporating three key innovations: (1) Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancer, which enhances subword token representations through token-aware contrastive learning to produce more discriminative and isotropic embeddings; (2) Cross-Layer Multi-Scale Aggregator, employing hierarchical aggregation of Transformer outputs via convolutional operations and gated MLPs to capture both local and global semantic patterns across layers; and (3) Blockwise Multi-Modal Coupler that decomposes URL-IP features into localized block units and computes cross-modal attention weights at the block level, enabling fine-grained inter-modal interaction. This architecture enables simultaneous preservation of fine-grained lexical cues, contextual semantics, and integration of network-level signals. Our evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets shows the framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06970v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot named entity recognition can identify new types of named entities based on a few labeled examples. Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

| **[Can Representation Gaps Be the Key to Enhancing Robustness in Graph-Text Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12087v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphShaper: Geometry-aware Alignment for Improving Transfer Learning in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12085v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20 percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce \textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Misinformation Recognition with Incomplete Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Misinformation Recognition has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of misinformation recognition in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.</p></details> |  |

However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing data augmentation-based contrastive learning, with a focus on SimCLR as a representative example. Our approach is based on the concept of \emph{approximate sufficient statistics}, which we extend beyond its original definition in \cite{oko2025statistical} for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using KL-divergence. We generalize it to equivalent forms and general f-divergences, and show that minimizing SimCLR and other contrastive losses yields encoders that are approximately sufficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these near-sufficient encoders can be effectively adapted to downstream regression and classification tasks, with performance depending on their sufficiency and the error induced by data augmentation in contrastive learning. Concrete examples in linear regression and topic classification are provided to illustrate the broad applicability of our results.</p></details> |  |

We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore, while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often overlooked during embedding training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities.

| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Local Manifold Learning for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19247v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods typically overlook local manifold structures, leading to compromised discriminative capabilities in perceptual quality evaluation. To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness. Patches from different images also act as inter-class negatives to enhance feature separation. Additionally, we introduce a mutual learning strategy to improve the model's ability to recognize and prioritize visually important regions. Comprehensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PLCC of 0.942 on TID2013 (compared to 0.908) and 0.977 on CSIQ (compared to 0.965).</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Music Sample Identification with Multi-Track Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11507v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning as Representation: Rethinking Visual Reinforcement Learning in Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11369v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Identity Signals in Conversational Facial Dynamics via Disentangled Expression Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11223v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Prototypes based Contrastive Learning for Classifying Multi-Label and Fine-Grained Educational Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11204v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names' vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rohit-gupta/MMContrast/tree/main/APPROVE</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2023</p></details> |

However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities, resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data availability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Source-Free Object Detection with Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11090v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |

We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations. The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

We present InstructUE, an instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations. InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space, thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user representation learning.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ML for Systems Workshop at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for physiological signals.</p></details> |  |

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture, portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score (0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives. Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of balancing positive and negative pair interactions.

Historical interaction sequences often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise. Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise, limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.</p></details> |  |

Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, Plus Appendices, EACL 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.</p></details> |  |

A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.</p></details> |  |

This field has seen significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames. Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets.

However, despite their ability to generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries, introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.</p></details> |  |

| **[Integrating Structural and Semantic Signals in Text-Attributed Graphs with BiGTex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12474v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Amplifying Prominent Representations in Multimodal Learning via Variational Dirichlet Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20736v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

| **[Structured Spectral Graph Representation Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Analysis from 3D CT Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10779v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most promising path towards true world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/Awesome-World-Models</p></details> |
| **[Connecting Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences: A New Bound for Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20644v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information. Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Diffusion Autoencoders with Perceivers for Long, Irregular and Multimodal Astronomical Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20595v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos. In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-efficient Learning of Concepts with Theoretical Guarantees: from Data to Concepts without Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06536v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is a vital part of many real-world systems, but several concerns remain about the lack of interpretability, explainability and robustness of black-box AI systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) address some of these challenges by learning interpretable concepts from high-dimensional data, e.g. images, which are used to predict labels. An important issue in CBMs are spurious correlation between concepts, which effectively lead to learning "wrong" concepts. Current mitigating strategies have strong assumptions, e.g., they assume that the concepts are statistically independent of each other, or require substantial interaction in terms of both interventions and labels provided by annotators. In this paper, we describe a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the learned concepts and on the number of required labels, without requiring any interventions. Our framework leverages causal representation learning (CRL) methods to learn latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations in a unsupervised way, and then learns to align these variables with interpretable concepts with few concept labels. We propose a linear and a non-parametric estimator for this mapping, providing a finite-sample high probability result in the linear case and an asymptotic consistency result for the non-parametric estimator. We evaluate our framework in synthetic and image benchmarks, showing that the learned concepts have less impurities and are often more accurate than other CBMs, even in settings with strong correlations between concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 23 figures, 12 Tables, Published</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images, while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual multicultural datasets.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2025 |
| **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025, 29 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |
| **[GUSL-Dehaze: A Green U-Shaped Learning Approach to Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20266v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image. While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning (GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Budgeted Embedding Table For Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14884v7)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learning based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e., embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-based action formulation and engaging set representation learning, we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular recommender models under different memory budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM 2024.

| **[Towards Objective Obstetric Ultrasound Assessment: Contrastive Representation Learning for Fetal Movement Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20214v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy, ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions, CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis, paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of the manuscript submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI) for review</p></details> |
| **[A Structured Review and Quantitative Profiling of Public Brain MRI Datasets for Foundation Model Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20196v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction, skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of generalizable brain MRI foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the Thirty Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2021), paper number 7926</p></details> |
| **[TOMCAT: Test-time Comprehensive Knowledge Accumulation for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20162v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

| **[Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the medical imaging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented in International Conference on Advancing Science and Technologies in Health Science</p></details> |
| **[Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines. For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness, overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning with Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13133v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.

| **[Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |

To address these challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures. This SRD is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans) encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD, combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark.

However, its application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP2025</p></details> |

A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the \textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages (26 main, 25 appendix, 6 references)</p></details> |

At its core is a canonical $ \varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a universal property: among all $ \varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most informative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This construction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors $ (Q_{\varepsilon} \dashv R_{\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric structure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as the unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and Lipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $ \mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for logically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with maximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is analyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An exact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the contraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation, adversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness and computational feasibility. The resulting framework provides principled targets for state aggregation and representation learning, with mathematically precise guarantees for value-function approximation in stochastic domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Noise-Resilient and Transferable Graph-Text Alignment via Dynamic Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19384v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together, these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise. Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in real-world web environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brain3D: Generating 3D Objects from fMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15239v5)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the hidden mechanisms behind human's visual perception is a fundamental question in neuroscience. To that end, investigating into the neural responses of human mind activities, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), has been a significant research vehicle. However, analyzing fMRI signals is challenging, costly, daunting, and demanding for professional training. Despite remarkable progress in fMRI analysis, existing approaches are limited to generating 2D images and far away from being biologically meaningful and practically useful. Under this insight, we propose to generate visually plausible and functionally more comprehensive 3D outputs decoded from brain signals, enabling more sophisticated modeling of fMRI data. Conceptually, we reformulate this task as a {\em fMRI conditioned 3D object generation} problem. We design a novel 3D object representation learning method, Brain3D, that takes as input the fMRI data of a subject who was presented with a 2D image, and yields as output the corresponding 3D object images. The key capabilities of this model include tackling the noises with high-level semantic signals and a two-stage architecture design for progressive high-level information integration. Extensive experiments validate the superior capability of our model over previous state-of-the-art 3D object generation methods. Importantly, we show that our model captures the distinct functionalities of each region of human vision system as well as their intricate interplay relationships, aligning remarkably with the established discoveries in neuroscience. Further, preliminary evaluations indicate that Brain3D can successfully identify the disordered brain regions in simulated scenarios, such as V1, V2, V3, V4, and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) within the human visual system. Our data and code will be available at https://brain-3d.github.io/.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 |
| **[From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19246v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Intelligence Without Statistics: The Invisible Backbone of Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19212v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however, obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is, and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference, Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence without statistical thought.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>- 17 ...</summary><p>- 17 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables - Submitted to IEEE JSAC Large AI Models for Future Wireless Communication Systems - Some of the results will appear in NeurIPS 2025, AI4NextG Workshop - This version is an extensive improvement in all aspects over the previous version with the same title - Dataset and implementation: https://github.com/BerkIGuler/WirelessContrastiveMaskedLearning</p></details> |
| **[X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19150v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

| **[VisDiff: SDF-Guided Polygon Generation for Visibility Reconstruction and Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05530v4)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to capture rich representations of combinatorial structures has enabled the application of machine learning to tasks such as analysis and generation of floorplans, terrains, images, and animations. Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$. We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Hierarchical Representation Learning of Samples and Features via Informed Tree-Wasserstein Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03627v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data often exhibit hierarchical structures in both modes: samples and features. Yet, most existing approaches for hierarchical representation learning consider only one mode at a time. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for jointly learning hierarchical representations of samples and features via Tree-Wasserstein Distance (TWD). Our method alternates between the two data modes. It first constructs a tree for one mode, then computes a TWD for the other mode based on that tree, and finally uses the resulting TWD to build the second mode's tree. By repeatedly alternating through these steps, the method gradually refines both trees and the corresponding TWDs, capturing meaningful hierarchical representations of the data. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our method converges. We show that our method can be integrated into hyperbolic graph convolutional networks as a pre-processing technique, improving performance in link prediction and node classification tasks. In addition, our method outperforms baselines in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning tasks on word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[AmorLIP: Efficient Language-Image Pretraining via Amortization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18983v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.</p></details> |  |

As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying and Enhancing Graph Transformers via a Hierarchical Mask Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18825v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks. Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information. To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our unified framework and model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 (Poster)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across a wide array of manipulation challenges.

However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning.

In this work, we proposed an anchor-based stage-wise learning strategy for robust speaker representation learning. Specifically, our approach begins by training a base model to establish discriminative speaker boundaries, and then extract anchor embeddings from this model as stable references. Finally, a copy of the base model is fine-tuned on noisy inputs, regularized by enforcing proximity to their corresponding fixed anchor embeddings to preserve speaker identity under distortion. Experimental results suggest that this strategy offers advantages over conventional joint optimization, particularly in maintaining discrimination while improving noise robustness. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across various noise conditions, potentially due to its ability to handle boundary stabilization and variation suppression separately.</p></details> |  |

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.

In real-world settings, however, the language-audio relationship is inherently many-to-many: one audio segment can be described by multiple captions and vice versa. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Language-Audio Pre-training (ProLAP), which models multiplicity as the spread of probability distributions in a joint language-audio embedding space. To train the intra-modal hierarchical relationship effectively, we also introduce two objectives: (i) hierarchical inclusion loss to promote semantic hierarchical understanding of inputs and (ii) mask repulsive loss to improve the efficiency of learning when optimizing the hierarchical inclusion loss. With this training strategy, our model can learn the hierarchical structure inherent in the data even from small datasets, in contrast to prior probabilistic approaches that rely on large-scale datasets. In our experiments, ProLAP outperforms existing deterministic approaches on audio-text retrieval tasks. Moreover, through experiments on the audio traversal task introduced in this paper, we demonstrate that ProLAP captures the plausible semantic hierarchy.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Towards Identifiability of Hierarchical Temporal Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18310v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results, we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference. This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Influence Component Analysis: A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Mixture Identifiability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17040v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18714v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE Access</p></details> |

However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality constraint, namely $\lambda$-Orthogonality regularization, while learning an affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across model updates.

Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised foundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external supervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning (SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous self-supervised learning methods have been proposed to address this challenge, a significant class of these approaches aligns the covariance or correlation matrix with the identity matrix. Despite impressive performance across various downstream tasks, these methods often suffer from biased sample risk, leading to substantial optimization shifts in mini-batch settings and complicating theoretical analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel \underline{\bf Adv}ersarial \underline{\bf S}elf-\underline{\bf S}upervised Representation \underline{\bf L}earning (Adv-SSL) for unbiased transfer learning with no additional cost compared to its biased counterparts. Our approach not only outperforms the existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets but is also supported by comprehensive end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Our analysis reveals that the minimax optimization in Adv-SSL encourages representations to form well-separated clusters in the embedding space, provided there is sufficient upstream unlabeled data. As a result, our method achieves strong classification performance even with limited downstream labels, shedding new light on few-shot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings.

Remote sensing offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently, self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning (multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research at https://github.com/PlekhanovaElena/ssl4eco.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, EarthVision workshop</p></details> |

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nearest-Class Mean and Logits Agreement for Wildlife Open-Set Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17338v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit, or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish animals.

To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.</p></details> |  |

Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories, without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at NeurIPS (2025) Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we take an alternative approach to enhance the generalization and robustness of MLLMs under distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of multiple MLLMs on open-ended and closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45 datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a minimal sufficient representation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games. Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a 0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose deep Fr\'echet neural networks (DFNNs), an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting non-Euclidean responses -- which are considered as random objects in a metric space -- from Euclidean predictors. Our method leverages the representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of approximating conditional Fr\'echet means of the response given the predictors, the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a Fr\'echet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In molecular representation learning, however, pretraining tasks remain largely restricted to node-level denoising, which effectively captures local atomic environments but is often insufficient for encoding the global molecular structure critical to graph-level property prediction tasks such as energy estimation and molecular regression. To address this gap, we introduce GeoRecon, a graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon formulates a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to produce an informative graph representation that guides geometry reconstruction while inducing smoother and more transferable latent spaces. This encourages the learning of coherent, global structural features beyond isolated atomic details. Without relying on external supervision, GeoRecon generally improves over backbone baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks including QM9, MD17, MD22, and 3BPA, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-level reconstruction for holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.</p></details> |  |

However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias" that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization, largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism. Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness, particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |

Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Generalizable Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16914v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

| **[Registration is a Powerful Rotation-Invariance Learner for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16865v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However, current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning. This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Domains and Contrasting Samples: A Ladder for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16704v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We provide a theoretical characterization of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary value, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately. Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCALAR: Self-Calibrating Adaptive Latent Attention Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16474v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration, enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships. Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Humanoid-inspired Causal Representation Learning for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16382v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal relationships and improving model robustness.

MLCPD contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers, MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema, language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval. Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema. We release the dataset publicly on Hugging Face and the accompanying codebase on GitHub, which includes complete pipelines for dataset reproduction, grammar compilation, and a visualization tool for exploring the unified AST across languages. Together, these resources establish MLCPD as an open, reproducible foundation for future research in cross-language representation learning and program analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms, and 34 references.

Integrating hyperedge disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition.

Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.</p></details> |  |

Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSRF: Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery for Incomplete Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16086v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding. Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability. To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework (FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task. Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous, modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate constraint paradigms for representation learning. Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing modalities.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Existing evaluations often rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels, temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.

As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, Camera-ready, EMBC 2025</p></details> |

However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline.

| **[When Does Closeness in Distribution Imply Representational Similarity? An Identifiability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03784v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback--Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models with near-maximum data likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations -- a phenomenon mirrored in our experiments with models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results thus clarify the link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</p></details> |  |

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes called landmarks. Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger real-world networks, offering a scalable and transferable alternative for graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Landm...</summary><p>Landmark-based embeddings preserve global distances in graphs more efficiently; on Erdos-Renyi random graphs they need lower dimensions, and GNNs generalize these embeddings to large real-world networks</p></details> |

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[DCMIL: A Progressive Representation Learning of Whole Slide Images for Cancer Prognosis Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14403v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions.

| **[FLEX: A Largescale Multimodal, Multiview Dataset for Learning Structured Representations for Fitness Action Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03198v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action Quality Assessment (AQA) -- the task of quantifying how well an action is performed -- has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

However, practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data -- let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts.

| **[Improving Intrusion Detection with Domain-Invariant Representation Learning in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17300v5)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-day anomaly detection is critical in industrial applications where novel, unforeseen threats can compromise system integrity and safety. Traditional detection systems often fail to identify these unseen anomalies due to their reliance on in-distribution data. Domain generalization addresses this gap by leveraging knowledge from multiple known domains to detect out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce a multi-task representation learning technique that fuses information across related domains into a unified latent space. By jointly optimizing classification, reconstruction, and mutual information regularization losses, our method learns a minimal(bottleneck), domain-invariant representation that discards spurious correlations. This latent space decorrelation enhances generalization, enabling the detection of anomalies in unseen domains. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-day or novel anomaly detection across diverse anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's eye-view scene representation that facilitates joint scene predictions without relying on manual labeling unlike commonly used trajectory prediction frameworks. Prior approaches have optimized deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures directly in grid cell space. While these methods have achieved some degree of success in prediction, they occasionally grapple with unrealistic and incorrect predictions. We claim that the quality and realism of the forecasted occupancy grids can be enhanced with the use of generative models. We propose a framework that decouples occupancy prediction into: representation learning and stochastic prediction within the learned latent space. Our approach allows for conditioning the model on other available sensor modalities such as RGB-cameras and high definition maps. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is readily transferable between different robotic platforms on the real-world NuScenes, Waymo Open, and a custom dataset we collected on an experimental vehicle platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We recommend referring to the peer-reviewed and updated version of this approach, available at arXiv:2407.21126</p></details> |
| **[Measure-Theoretic Anti-Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18052v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics. Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our approach for robust anti-causal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-Form Training Dynamics Reveal Learned Features and Linear Structure in Word2Vec-like Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised word embedding algorithms such as word2vec provide a minimal setting for studying representation learning in language modeling. We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Programmatic Representation Learning with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3 algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and understood.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/gpoesia/leapr/</p></details> |
