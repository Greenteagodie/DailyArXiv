| **[OmniWorld: A Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset for 4D World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12201v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |
| **[Enriched text-guided variational multimodal knowledge distillation network (VMD) for automated diagnosis of plaque vulnerability in 3D carotid artery MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11924v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight paper</p></details> |
| **[DMLDroid: Deep Multimodal Fusion Framework for Android Malware Detection with Resilience to Code Obfuscation and Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11187v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, learning-based Android malware detection has seen significant advancements, with detectors generally falling into three categories: string-based, image-based, and graph-based approaches. While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11102v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

| **[Why Bonds Fail Differently? Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abn-BLIP: Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis and Report Generation from CTPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02034v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting.

| **[Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE, a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Online Learning by Integrating Biosensors and Multimodal Learning Analytics for Detecting and Predicting Student Behavior: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07742v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern online learning, understanding and predicting student behavior is crucial for enhancing engagement and optimizing educational outcomes. This systematic review explores the integration of biosensors and Multimodal Learning Analytics (MmLA) to analyze and predict student behavior during computer-based learning sessions. We examine key challenges, including emotion and attention detection, behavioral analysis, experimental design, and demographic considerations in data collection. Our study highlights the growing role of physiological signals, such as heart rate, brain activity, and eye-tracking, combined with traditional interaction data and self-reports to gain deeper insights into cognitive states and engagement levels. We synthesize findings from 54 key studies, analyzing commonly used methodologies such as advanced machine learning algorithms and multimodal data pre-processing techniques. The review identifies current research trends, limitations, and emerging directions in the field, emphasizing the transformative potential of biosensor-driven adaptive learning systems. Our findings suggest that integrating multimodal data can facilitate personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and intelligent educational interventions, ultimately advancing toward a more customized and adaptive online learning experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Behaviour & Information Technology (Taylor & Francis).

| **[MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08040v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19769v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.</p></details> | 13pages,7 figures |
| **[Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from each modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme. UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance improvement in multimodal learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection, formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IUI2026</p></details> |

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal learning of melt pool dynamics in laser powder bed fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03029v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has broad applicability in additive manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Resilient Multimodal Industrial Surface Defect Detection with Uncertain Sensors Availability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02962v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

| **[OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at: https://github.com/peng-lab/hescape</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities. Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose ConfSMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture by taking the opinion of experts and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, ConfSMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth signal. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. The proposed method is evaluated on four different real world dataset with three distinct experiment settings to conduct comprehensive analysis of ConfSMoE on resistance to missing modality and the impacts of proposed gating mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Multi-modal Learning of Histology and Transcriptomics for Cancer Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16479v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

| **[A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Information Fusion</p></details> |

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Analysis of Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14926v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</p></details> | 34 pages |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

| **[SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture. Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

While effective in bi-modal setups, these approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER, a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned embedding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection, but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1) \emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a \emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains \(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components, positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for multimodal product classification.</p></details> |  |

The usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior. In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation, classification, and regression tasks.

While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data. TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited modalities.

However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers, enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently, state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications. To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding the Multimodal Maze: A Systematic Review on the Adoption of Explainability in Multimodal Attention-based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04427v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance, their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning.

| **[T2UE: Generating Unlearnable Examples from Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03091v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level. The extensive experiments demonstrate that Kestrel effectively bridges the gap between part-aware language understanding and 3D segmentation grounding, paving the way for more robust and interpretable 3D object comprehension that meets the demands of real-world robotic applications.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |

The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |

This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[One-stage Modality Distillation for Incomplete Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08204v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Everything is a Video: Unifying Modalities through Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10503v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TransPrune: Token Transition Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20630v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL.

While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health.

TD-Interpreter is a visual question-answer environment which allows engineers to input a set of TDs and ask design and verification queries regarding these TDs. We implemented TD-Interpreter with multimodal learning by fine-tuning LLaVA, a lightweight 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). To address limited training data availability, we developed a synthetic data generation workflow that aligns visual information with its textual interpretation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of TD-Interpreter which outperformed untuned GPT-4o by a large margin on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMID-Net: An Exploration of Masked Image Modeling and Knowledge Distillation in Hyperbolic Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09487v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified the abstract and reformatted it using latex</p></details> |

These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on DataWorld</p></details> |

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[City-VLM: Towards Multidomain Perception Scene Understanding via Multimodal Incomplete Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12795v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation). Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

However, most current methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks: canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping. The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low-data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong performances near or better than the state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

| **[Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.</p></details> | acm multimedia 2025 |
| **[A Robust Incomplete Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation Approach for Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11202v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10213v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and is currently under review</p></details> |

While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent challenges and future directions.

However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAIP 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.08716</p></details> |

Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions.

Where Do We Stand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10966v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of brain infarction (i.e., irreversibly damaged tissue) is critical for guiding treatment decisions in acute ischemic stroke. Reliable infarct prediction informs key clinical interventions, including the need for patient transfer to comprehensive stroke centers, the potential benefit of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, decisions regarding secondary neuroprotective treatments, and ultimately, prognosis of clinical outcomes. This work introduces the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2024 challenge, which focuses on the prediction of final infarct volumes from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES24 provides a comprehensive, multimodal setting where participants can leverage all clinically and practically available data, including full acute CT imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and structured clinical information, across a train set of 150 cases. On the hidden test set of 98 cases, the top-performing model, a multimodal nnU-Net-based architecture, achieved a Dice score of 0.285 (+/- 0.213) and an absolute volume difference of 21.2 (+/- 37.2) mL, underlining the significant challenges posed by this task and the need for further advances in multimodal learning. This work makes two primary contributions: first, we establish a standardized, clinically realistic benchmark for post-treatment infarct prediction, enabling systematic evaluation of multimodal algorithmic strategies on a longitudinal stroke dataset; second, we analyze current methodological limitations and outline key research directions to guide the development of next-generation infarct prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.

These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Our standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology, that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology (SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes. Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gated Recursive Fusion: A Stateful Approach to Scalable Multimodal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02985v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This request is based on the fact that one of the co-authors is a PhD student whose advisor has informed her that she was not authorized to publicly release this work without his prior approval.

However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Test-Time Consistency in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22395v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency. Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

Inspired by the emerging Selective State Space Model (Mamba) with nearly linear computational complexity and efficient long-term modeling, we present a novel HSI denoising network named HSIDMamba (HSDM). HSDM is tailored to exploit the capture of potential spatial-spectral dependencies effectively and efficiently for HSI denoising. In particular, HSDM comprises multiple Hyperspectral Continuous Scan Blocks (HCSB) to strengthen spatial-spectral interactions. HCSB links forward and backward scans and enhances information from eight directions through the State Space Model (SSM), strengthening the context representation learning of HSDM and improving denoising performance more effectively. In addition, to enhance the utilization of spectral information and mitigate the degradation problem caused by long-range scanning, spectral attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations against HSI denoising benchmarks validate the superior performance of HSDM, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing the efficiency of the transformer method SERT by 31%.</p></details> |  |

First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss. In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is deployed in.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAM++: Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12039v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++), a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at https://github.com/DragonisCV/RAM</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

Orthogonal to advancements in generative VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 CDEL Workshop</p></details> |

Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

| **[PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11362v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Network Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11316v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network representation learning seeks to embed networks into a low-dimensional space while preserving the structural and semantic properties, thereby facilitating downstream tasks such as classification, trait prediction, edge identification, and community detection. Motivated by challenges in brain connectivity data analysis that is characterized by subject-specific, high-dimensional, and sparse networks that lack node or edge covariates, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based statistical approach for network edge embedding, which we name as Adaptive Contrastive Edge Representation Learning (ACERL). It builds on two key components: contrastive learning of augmented network pairs, and a data-driven adaptive random masking mechanism. We establish the non-asymptotic error bounds, and show that our method achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate for edge representation learning. We further demonstrate the applicability of the learned representation in multiple downstream tasks, including network classification, important edge detection, and community detection, and establish the corresponding theoretical guarantees. We validate our method through both synthetic data and real brain connectivities studies, and show its competitive performance compared to the baseline method of sparse principal components analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pretrained Molecular Embedding Models For Molecular Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06199v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SPARK.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 -- across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong generalization to unknown intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

This dissertation employs computational social science techniques to investigate these issues, understand the social dynamics driving negative online behaviors, and propose data-driven solutions for healthier digital interactions. I begin by introducing a scalable social network representation learning method that integrates user-generated content with social connections to create unified user embeddings, enabling accurate prediction and visualization of user attributes, communities, and behavioral propensities. Using this tool, I explore three interrelated problems: 1) COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, revealing polarization and asymmetric political echo chambers; 2) online hate speech, suggesting the pursuit of social approval motivates toxic behavior; and 3) moral underpinnings of COVID-19 discussions, uncovering patterns of moral homophily and echo chambers, while also indicating moral diversity and plurality can improve message reach and acceptance across ideological divides. These findings contribute to the advancement of computational social science and provide a foundation for understanding human behavior through the lens of social interactions and network homophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California, 2024</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep reinforcement learning-based path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark.

| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |

Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

| **[VRAE: Vertical Residual Autoencoder for License Plate Denoising and Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08392v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in https://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Unveiling Structural Patterns in Graphs via Mixture of Subgraph Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09337v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns. leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL. Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Rethinking Disentanglement under Dependent Factors of Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07016v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning is an approach that allows to discover and extract the factors of variation from the data. Intuitively, a representation is said to be disentangled if it separates the different factors of variation in a way that is understandable to humans. Definitions of disentanglement and metrics to measure it usually assume that the factors of variation are independent of each other. However, this is generally false in the real world, which limits the use of these definitions and metrics to very specific and unrealistic scenarios. In this paper we give a definition of disentanglement based on information theory that is also valid when the factors of variation are not independent. Furthermore, we relate this definition to the Information Bottleneck Method. Finally, we propose a method to measure the degree of disentanglement from the given definition that works when the factors of variation are not independent. We show through different experiments that the method proposed in this paper correctly measures disentanglement with non-independent factors of variation, while other methods fail in this scenario.</p></details> |  |

This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main</p></details> |

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks, potentially enhancing their performance.

Learned features demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA (SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning, which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 27,927x speedup versus a traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements when training on MD simulations.

Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

| **[Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13812v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing point cloud representation learning methods primarily rely on data-driven strategies to extract geometric information from large amounts of scattered data. However, most methods focus solely on the spatial distribution features of point clouds while overlooking the relationship between local information and the whole structure, which limits the accuracy of point cloud representation. Local information reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric features. Therefore, the appropriate introduction of physics-driven mechanism can effectively compensate for the limitations of data-driven methods in structural modeling and significantly enhance the generalization and interpretability of point cloud representations in downstream tasks such as understanding and recognition. Inspired by this, we incorporate a physics-driven mechanism into the data-driven method to learn fine-grained features in point clouds and model the structural relationship between local regions and the whole shape. Specifically, we design a dual-task encoder-decoder framework that combines the geometric modeling capability of data-driven implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. Through the integration of physics-based loss functions, the framework is guided to predict localized deformation and explicitly capture the correspondence between local structural changes and whole shape variations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in object classification and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chirality in Action: Time-Aware Video Representation Learning by Latent Straightening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08502v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Joint Learning using Mixture-of-Expert-Based Representation for Enhanced Speech Generation and Robust Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08470v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method is a self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader field of video analysis and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimCroP: Radiograph Representation Learning with Similarity-driven Cross-granularity Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08311v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-, and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a visual prior-guided vision-language model, PriorCLIP, which leverages visual priors for unbiased representation learning and adaptive vision-language alignment. In the closed-domain setting, PriorCLIP introduces two Progressive Attention Encoder (PAE) structures: Spatial-PAE constructs a belief matrix with instruction embeddings to filter key features and mitigate semantic bias. At the same time, Temporal-PAE exploits cyclic activation across time steps to enhance text representation. For the open-domain setting, we design a two-stage prior representation learning strategy, consisting of large-scale pre-training on coarse-grained image-text pairs, followed by fine-tuning on fine-grained pairs using vision-instruction, which enables robust retrieval across long-tail concepts and vocabulary shifts. Furthermore, a cluster-based symmetric contrastive Attribution Loss is proposed to constrain inter-class relations and alleviate semantic confusion in the shared embedding space. Extensive experiments on RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that PriorCLIP achieves substantial improvements, outperforming existing methods by 4.9% and 4.0% in closed-domain retrieval, and by 7.3% and 9.4% in open-domain retrieval, respectively.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations. Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia, for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts, PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline, underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance: PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e., they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability. This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences, implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability. Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of existing unlearnable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method.

This deviates from the expectation that the model should incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone mapping operators, which struggle to handle the diverse appearances and degradations commonly present in real-world SDR content. To address this limitation, we propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR framework that enhances robustness by learning attribute-disentangled representations. Central to our approach is Realistic Attribute-Disentangled Representation Learning (RealRep), which explicitly disentangles luminance and chrominance components to capture intrinsic content variations across different SDR distributions. Furthermore, we design a Luma-/Chroma-aware negative exemplar generation strategy that constructs degradation-sensitive contrastive pairs, effectively modeling tone discrepancies across SDR styles. Building on these attribute-level priors, we introduce the Degradation-Domain Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a lightweight, two-stage framework that performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via degradation-conditioned features, enabling robust adaptation across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealRep consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%, BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image segmentation.

To address these problems, we propose a new method that unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW. Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks and fields, compared to prior models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Kernel VICReg for Self-Supervised Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07289v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance, invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear feature learning without explicit mappings. We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data. Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with modern representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fed-REACT: Federated Representation Learning for Heterogeneous and Evolving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07198v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments, client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data. Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Music Autotagging with MGPHot Expert Annotations vs. Generic Tag Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06936v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music autotagging aims to automatically assign descriptive tags, such as genre, mood, or instrumentation, to audio recordings. Due to its challenges, diversity of semantic descriptions, and practical value in various applications, it has become a common downstream task for evaluating the performance of general-purpose music representations learned from audio data. We introduce a new benchmarking dataset based on the recently published MGPHot dataset, which includes expert musicological annotations, allowing for additional insights and comparisons with results obtained on common generic tag datasets. While MGPHot annotations have been shown to be useful for computational musicology, the original dataset neither includes audio nor provides evaluation setups for its use as a standardized autotagging benchmark. To address this, we provide a curated set of YouTube URLs with retrievable audio, and propose a train/val/test split for standardized evaluation, and precomputed representations for seven state-of-the-art models. Using these resources, we evaluated these models in MGPHot and standard reference tag datasets, highlighting key differences between expert and generic tag annotations. Altogether, our contributions provide a more advanced benchmarking framework for future research in music understanding.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches such as contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders address this challenge with varying trade-offs. In this paper, we introduce the {contrastive Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that augments the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a novel contrastive objective. While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latent variables and encourages clustering of latent codes, its representations underperform on discriminative tasks compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. cMIM addresses this limitation by enforcing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative strengths. We present two main contributions: (1) we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that eliminates the need for positive data augmentation and is robust to batch size, unlike InfoNCE-based methods; (2) we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for extracting enriched representations from encoder--decoder models that substantially improve discriminative performance without additional training, and which apply broadly beyond MIM. Empirical results demonstrate that cMIM consistently outperforms MIM and InfoNCE in classification and regression tasks, while preserving comparable reconstruction quality. These findings suggest that cMIM provides a unified framework for learning representations that are simultaneously effective for discriminative and generative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A wor...</summary><p>A working draft.

| **[Multimodal Latent Fusion of ECG Leads for Early Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13470v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in early assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily focus on applying machine learning methods to centralized diagnostic modalities, such as 12-lead electrocardiogram (12L-ECG). Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability.

| **[BriLLM: Brain-inspired Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11299v8)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BriLLM, a brain-inspired large language model that fundamentally redefines the foundations of machine learning through its implementation of Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) learning. This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |

An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets, open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are interested in asking: What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the learning process? To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of various types of unusual atypical data (e.g., sci-fi, animation, etc.). To study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset, encouraging further studies in this direction.

While large language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically, Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06306v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However, relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenAI-Powered Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03897v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models -- such as large language models and diffusion models -- not only to generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional representations that are guaranteed to capture their underlying structure. Applying machine learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2) estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.</p></details> |  |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06015v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions. Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation. Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image. The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11% over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods are limited in recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and clinical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.</p></details> | SIGSPATIAL 25 |

This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build ShapeSplat, a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet, ModelNet and Objaverse datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 206K objects spanning over 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 3.8 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU. We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as 3DV'25 Oral, project page: https://unique1i.github.io/ShapeSplat_webpage/</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05757v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding, text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area. Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures, hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs (HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4) hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models, datasets, and code implementations is available at https://github.com/sarangp2402/Hyperbolic-LLM-Models/tree/main.</p></details> | 32 pages, 6 figures |

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

While most self-supervised representation learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[DuoCLR: Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Human Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05543v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting representations of the same action class across different permutations, while ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 accepted paper</p></details> |

While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[SL-SLR: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05188v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.</p></details> |  |

While existing embedding methods effectively preserve local similarity measures, they often fail to capture global functions like graph distances. Inspired by Bourgain's seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings of metric spaces (1985), we study the performance of local distance-preserving node embeddings. Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes called landmarks. Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger real-world networks, offering a scalable and transferable alternative for graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Landm...</summary><p>Landmark-based embeddings preserve global distances in graphs more efficiently; on Erdos-Renyi random graphs they need lower dimensions, and GNNs generalize these embeddings to large real-world networks</p></details> |

However, models relying solely on urbanization traits often show weak correlations with poverty indicators, as unplanned urban growth can obscure economic disparities and spatial inequalities. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel representation learning framework that captures multidimensional deprivation-related traits from very high-resolution satellite imagery for precise urban poverty mapping. Our approach integrates three complementary traits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode proximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from building footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and (3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic activity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from non-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we incorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits during training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features into a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of poverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations across three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for poverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach. Code and model are available at https://github.com/shunyuzh/MSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method learns a mapping from modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific modifier types.

However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Representation Learning for Multi-Intent Diversity and Behavioral Uncertainty in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04694v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in real-world recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Our upstream models are trained on extensive data sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks, including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems, resulting in significant gains in online metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.</p></details> |  |

However, current general-purpose music representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music, expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music, achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2025)</p></details> |

However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA25)</p></details> |

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns. Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.</p></details> |  |

These issues often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging, where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However, existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly, lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end multibias solution for visual recognition.

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency. However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets, including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for robust mitosis analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figures, final submission for MIDOG 2025 challenge</p></details> |
| **[Domain Consistency Representation Learning for Lifelong Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19954v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) exhibits a contradictory relationship between intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps when learning from continuous data. Intra-domain discrimination focuses on individual nuances (i.e., clothing type, accessories, etc.), while inter-domain gaps emphasize domain consistency. Achieving a trade-off between maximizing intra-domain discrimination and minimizing inter-domain gaps is a crucial challenge for improving LReID performance. Most existing methods strive to reduce inter-domain gaps through knowledge distillation to maintain domain consistency. However, they often ignore intra-domain discrimination. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain consistency representation learning (DCR) model that explores global and attribute-wise representations as a bridge to balance intra-domain discrimination and inter-domain gaps. At the intra-domain level, we explore the complementary relationship between global and attribute-wise representations to improve discrimination among similar identities. Excessive learning intra-domain discrimination can lead to catastrophic forgetting. We further develop an attribute-oriented anti-forgetting (AF) strategy that explores attribute-wise representations to enhance inter-domain consistency, and propose a knowledge consolidation (KC) strategy to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DCR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LReID methods.

When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

We pursue a cost-driven approach, where a dynamic model in some latent state space is learned by predicting the costs without predicting the observations or actions. In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model, for finite-horizon time-varying LQG control problems. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, finite-sample guarantees of such a cost-driven approach remain elusive. Our result underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations. A second part of this work, that is to appear as Part II, addresses the infinite-horizon linear time-invariant setting; it also extends the results to an approach that implicitly learns the latent dynamics, inspired by the recent empirical breakthrough of MuZero in model-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages; extended journal version, with an end-to-end guarantee added</p></details> |

Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, ACM Multimedia 2025 Dataset Track</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |

Our work is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as "social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations influence misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model.

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drifting Away from Truth: GenAI-Driven News Diversity Challenges LVLM-Based Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12711v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  |

Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii) factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to 5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale quality across all three dimensions.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links, and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels. However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER, we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025. 11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Toward Verifiable Misinformation Detection: A Multi-Tool LLM Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03092v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory Network for Multi-modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02479v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection. The code and data have been released.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated code and dataset, see https://github.com/neu-vi/XFacta</p></details> |

To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection.

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on developing datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting model robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To address, we introduce "Miscaption This!", a collection of LVLM-generated miscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better to real-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Lacking robust automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation generation to low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.</p></details> |  |

This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information.

To control their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative, inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second, the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures.

Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain. This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and other low-moderation social platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, only a few studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR). The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.</p></details> |  |

Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion.

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Truth over Tricks: Measuring and Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02350v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e., \emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation. This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Large Language Models for Misinformation Detection in Low-Resource Linguistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01587v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection.

| **[Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Stance Detection: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08464v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |
| **[CAMOUFLAGE: Exploiting Misinformation Detection Systems Through LLM-driven Adversarial Claim Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01900v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |

While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GenAI vs. Human Fact-Checkers: Accurate Ratings, Flawed Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14943v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |

We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators.

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpMis: An Investigation of Synthetic Spoken Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11308v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, speech generation technology has advanced rapidly, fueled by generative models and large-scale training techniques. While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Logic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05964v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation on online social platforms is becoming a critical concern due to increasing credibility and easier dissemination brought by multimedia content, compared to traditional text-only information. While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

| **[Exploring the Role of Audio in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12558v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of deepfake technology, especially the deep audio fake technology, misinformation detection on the social media scene meets a great challenge. Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning. We make our code and data publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Code available at https://github.com/UKPLab/5pils</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PACIS 2024. 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[ConspEmoLLM: Conspiracy Theory Detection Using an Emotion-Based Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06765v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

| **[Why Misinformation is Created? Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19192v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14321v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for misinformation detection and fact checking. Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Similarity over Factuality: Are we making progress on multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13488v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12190v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench</p></details> |

While prior work has demonstrated these risks, little is known about how users estimate and respond. We conducted a survey with 240 U.S. participants who judged text snippets for inference risks, reported concern levels, and attempted rewrites to block inference. We compared their rewrites with those generated by ChatGPT and Rescriber, a state-of-the-art sanitization tool. Results show that participants struggled to anticipate inference, performing a little better than chance. User rewrites were effective in just 28\% of cases - better than Rescriber but worse than ChatGPT. We examined our participants' rewriting strategies, and observed that while paraphrasing was the most common strategy it is also the least effective; instead abstraction and adding ambiguity were more successful. Our work highlights the importance of inference-aware design in LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuantAgent: Price-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for High-Frequency Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09995v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming random prediction baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</p></details> |  |

Yet such intents are often underspecified and evolve during interaction, dynamic support for intent communication is essential. Through a systematic literature review of 33 papers, we synthesize a structured understanding of intent communication, identifying four key aspects: articulation, exploration, management, and synchronization. Building on these findings, we derived design implications that translate them into actionable design and implemented IntentFlow, a system for LLM-based writing that realizes these implications through adjustable UIs, intent-to-output linking, and versioned refinement. A technical evaluation (N=60) and a within-subjects study (N=12) confirm that IntentFlow helps users discover, elaborate, and consolidate their intents into a curated set. Interaction logs further reveal a shift from reactive error correction to proactive intent refinement. Our work demonstrates how a system effectively designed to support these four communication aspects can substantially enhance human-LLM interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPar: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Parallel and Accelerated Code Translation in HPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12136v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages. In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations. Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem. UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE HPEC conference 2025. 9 pages, incl references</p></details> |
| **[SafeSwitch: Steering Unsafe LLM Behavior via Internal Activation Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01042v5)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities across various tasks but also pose risks by generating harmful content. Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls.

Studying instructors' usage is critical, given their role in teaching and guiding AI adoption in education. We designed and evaluated TeaPT, an LLM for pedagogical purposes that supports instructors' professional development through two conversational approaches: a Socratic approach that uses guided questioning to foster reflection, and a Narrative approach that offers elaborated suggestions to extend externalized cognition. In a mixed-method study with 41 higher-education instructors, the Socratic version elicited greater engagement, while the Narrative version was preferred for actionable guidance. Subgroup analyses further revealed that less-experienced, AI-optimistic instructors favored the Socratic version, whereas more-experienced, AI-cautious instructors preferred the Narrative version. We contribute design implications for LLMs for pedagogical purposes, showing how adaptive conversational approaches can support instructors with varied profiles while highlighting how AI attitudes and experience shape interaction and learning.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments, enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods. Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools. JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at CIKM 2025 (Demo Track)</p></details> |

Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/kfq20/EvoBot.</p></details> |  |

A Comparison with Human Therapists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12102v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited access to mental health care has motivated the use of digital tools and conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs), yet their quality and reception remain unclear. We present a study comparing therapist-written responses to those generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama for real patient questions. Text analysis showed that LLMs produced longer, more readable, and lexically richer responses with a more positive tone, while therapist responses were more often written in the first person. In a survey with 150 users and 23 licensed therapists, participants rated LLM responses as clearer, more respectful, and more supportive than therapist-written answers. Yet, both groups of participants expressed a stronger preference for human therapist support. These findings highlight the promise and limitations of LLMs in mental health, underscoring the need for designs that balance their communicative strengths with concerns of trust, privacy, and accountability.</p></details> |  |

Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |

While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Computer Architecture Letter</p></details> |

Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</p></details> |  |

As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics, including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the documents they use as their information sources. In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether these arguments are the same for different LLMs. In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance, highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

While LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic linguistic conditions.

A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337v5)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

To address these challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback, allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong practical utility and effective performance.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle with logic problems and puzzles that are relatively easy for humans. To further investigate this, we introduce a new benchmark, SearchBench, which contains 11 unique search problems inspired by intuitive puzzles. Each SearchBench problem type is equipped with automated pipelines to generate an arbitrary number of instances and analyze the feasibility, correctness, and optimality of LLM-generated solutions. We show that using step-by-step, language-only reasoning, even the most advanced LLMs fail to solve SearchBench; for example, OpenAI's frontier models GPT-4 and o1-preview solve only 1.4% and 18.6% of problems, respectively. The reason is that SearchBench problems require considering multiple pathways and performing backtracking, posing a significant challenge to auto-regressive models. Interestingly, performance is significantly boosted when we prompt models to generate a complete A* search algorithm - a comparatively more cognitively difficult task. This approach effectively offloads the iterative search and backtracking process from the models, which they struggle with in text. This in-context learning baseline is further enhanced via a Multi-Stage-Multi-Try (MSMT) inference method, increasing GPT-4's rate of correct solutions to over 57%.</p></details> |  |

It requires the injection of domain-specific knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content, they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and real-world settings.

Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.</p></details> | under review |

Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |

Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p></details> |  |

This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attack, where an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an Large Language Model (LLM) follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task, represent a critical security threat. Existing attacks primarily focus on crafting these injections at inference time, treating the LLM itself as a static target. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we introduces a more foundational attack vector: poisoning the LLM's alignment process to amplify the success of future prompt injection attacks. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method that strategically creates poisoned alignment samples to poison an LLM's alignment dataset. Our experiments across five LLMs and two alignment datasets show that when even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned, the resulting model becomes substantially more vulnerable to a wide range of prompt injection attacks. Crucially, this vulnerability is instilled while the LLM's performance on standard capability benchmarks remains largely unchanged, making the manipulation difficult to detect through automated, general-purpose performance evaluations. The code for implementing the attack is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding in Latent Spaces for Efficient Inference in LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11524v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for recommendation in a generative manner has delivered promising results, but encounters significant inference overhead due to autoregressive decoding in the language space. This work explores bypassing language-space decoding by directly matching candidate items with the LLM's internal thought representations in the latent space, eliminating the time-consuming autoregressive process to reduce computational costs. Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an effective and efficient latent-space decoding method. L2D represents user-preferred items by using the hidden states of test sequences reflecting the LLM's internal thought, and obtains candidate item representations from the hidden states of training sequences labeled with the corresponding candidate items. It then matches the two types of representations to decode items, achieving latent-space decoding. In this way, it enables efficient decoding without altering the LLM's generative tuning paradigm, thereby preserving performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that L2D is more than 10x faster than language-space decoding while maintaining or enhancing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in EMNLP'25</p></details> |

However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper details our submission to the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Task~2, which challenges systems to perform claim normalization across twenty languages, divided into thirteen supervised (high-resource) and seven zero-shot (no training data) tracks. Our approach, leveraging fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for supervised languages and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting for zero-shot scenarios, achieved podium positions (top three) in fifteen of the twenty languages. Notably, this included second-place rankings in eight languages, five of which were among the seven designated zero-shot languages, underscoring the effectiveness of our LLM-based zero-shot strategy. For Portuguese, our initial development language, our system achieved an average METEOR score of 0.5290, ranking third.

Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Uncertainty of LLM Explanations: A Perspective Based on Reasoning Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17026v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures; accepted at COLM'25</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches to CR-specifically the Question-Answering (QA) Template and Document Template methods and propose two novel techniques: Reversed Training with Joint Inference and Iterative Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution. Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models (LLMs) for Requirements Engineering (RE): A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11446v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are finding applications in numerous domains, and Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly benefiting from their capabilities to assist with complex, language-intensive tasks. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 74 primary studies published between 2023 and 2024, examining how LLMs are being applied in RE. The study categorizes the literature according to several dimensions, including publication trends, RE activities, prompting strategies, and evaluation methods. Our findings indicate notable patterns, among which we observe substantial differences compared to previous works leveraging standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Most of the studies focus on using LLMs for requirements elicitation and validation, rather than defect detection and classification, which were dominant in the past. Researchers have also broadened their focus and addressed novel tasks, e.g., test generation, exploring the integration of RE with other software engineering (SE) disciplines. Although requirements specifications remain the primary focus, other artifacts are increasingly considered, including issues from issue tracking systems, regulations, and technical manuals. The studies mostly rely on GPT-based models, and often use Zero-shot or Few-shot prompting. They are usually evaluated in controlled environments, with limited use in industry settings and limited integration in complex workflows. Our study outlines important future directions, such as leveraging the potential to expand the influence of RE in SE, exploring less-studied tasks, improving prompting methods, and testing in real-world environments. Our contribution also helps researchers and practitioners use LLMs more effectively in RE, by providing a list of identified tools leveraging LLMs for RE, as well as datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions.

In this paper, we investigate the linguistic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) by introducing IOLBENCH, a novel benchmark derived from International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) problems. This dataset encompasses diverse problems testing syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics, all carefully designed to be self-contained and independent of external knowledge. These tasks challenge models to engage in metacognitive linguistic reasoning, requiring the deduction of linguistic rules and patterns from minimal examples. Through extensive benchmarking of leading LLMs, we find that even the most advanced models struggle to handle the intricacies of linguistic complexity, particularly in areas demanding compositional generalization and rule abstraction. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and persistent limitations of current models in linguistic problem-solving, offering valuable insights into their reasoning capabilities. By introducing IOLBENCH, we aim to foster further research into developing models capable of human-like reasoning, with broader implications for the fields of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Recency Bias in LLM-Based Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11353v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in information systems, including being used as second-stage rerankers in information retrieval pipelines, yet their susceptibility to recency bias has received little attention. We investigate whether LLMs implicitly favour newer documents by prepending artificial publication dates to passages in the TREC Deep Learning passage retrieval collections in 2021 (DL21) and 2022 (DL22). Across seven models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4, LLaMA-3 8B/70B, and Qwen-2.5 7B/72B, "fresh" passages are consistently promoted, shifting the Top-10's mean publication year forward by up to 4.78 years and moving individual items by as many as 95 ranks in our listwise reranking experiments. Although larger models attenuate the effect, none eliminate it. We also observe that the preference of LLMs between two passages with an identical relevance level can be reversed by up to 25% on average after date injection in our pairwise preference experiments. These findings provide quantitative evidence of a pervasive recency bias in LLMs and highlight the importance of effective bias-mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Such characteristics enable more intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters. This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic, behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP main proceedings; Updated citations</p></details> |

This paper explores the role of personas in the creation of ESC by LLMs. Our research utilizes established psychological frameworks to measure and infuse persona traits into LLMs, which then generate dialogues in the emotional support scenario. We conduct extensive evaluations to understand the stability of persona traits in dialogues, examining shifts in traits post-generation and their impact on dialogue quality and strategy distribution. Experimental results reveal several notable findings: 1) LLMs can infer core persona traits, 2) subtle shifts in emotionality and extraversion occur, influencing the dialogue dynamics, and 3) the application of persona traits modifies the distribution of emotional support strategies, enhancing the relevance and empathetic quality of the responses. These findings highlight the potential of persona-driven LLMs in crafting more personalized, empathetic, and effective emotional support dialogues, which has significant implications for the future design of AI-driven emotional support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts. Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual understanding capabilities of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of work originally submitted to AAAI 2026.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising interface for translating complex and ambiguous natural language instructions into actionable plans. However, their probabilistic and opaque nature often leads to logically inconsistent or infeasible outputs. To address these limitations, recent frameworks combine LLMs with symbolic planners by first generating action models (Planning Domain Definition Language) and then applying heuristic search. Although promising, such systems still suffer from representation redundancy and exponential search complexity, often resulting in inefficient or overly long plans. To improve planning efficiency and effectiveness, we propose PLAHX (Planning from Language using Abstraction and Heuristic eXploration), a two-stage LLM-symbolic planning framework that integrates abstract symbolic representations with meta-heuristic subspace search in a parallel and iterative fashion. Rather than relying on verbose LLM-generated domain models, we introduce a minimalist symbolic abstraction pipeline that preserves semantic fidelity while eliminating redundancy. Our approach redefines LLM-symbolic planning not by making LLMs smarter, but by reducing the symbolic search space adaptively. Empirical results across four challenging domains, including block stacking and robotic mobile grasping, show that our approach improves the success rate by 21.47% on average, while reducing token consumption by 13% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies treat memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains, which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code and results are available publicly at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/LLM-Memorization_SK_Eval-.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.</p></details> | Preprint |

To effectively address these issues, we propose a Query-toRecommendation, a parallel recommendation framework that decouples LLMs from candidate pre-selection and instead enables direct retrieval over the entire item pool. Our framework connects LLMs and recommendation models in a parallel manner, allowing each component to independently utilize its strengths without interfering with the other. In this framework, LLMs are utilized to generate feature-enriched item descriptions and personalized user queries, allowing for capturing diverse preferences and enabling rich semantic matching in a zero-shot manner. To effectively combine the complementary strengths of LLM and collaborative signals, we introduce an adaptive reranking strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate an improvement in performance up to 57%, while also improving the novelty and diversity of recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing LLMs in Art Contexts: Critique Generation and Theory of Mind Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12805v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas related to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states (Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex, socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might assume.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected a typo in the metadata title only ("Assesing"->"Assessing").

| **[AQUA: Attention via QUery mAgnitudes for Memory and Compute Efficient Inference in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11155v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries. To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |

However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment. This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving. Code of VoltanaLLM is open-sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/VoltanaLLM.</p></details> |  |

While usually associated with friendliness or playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5 mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)</p></details> |  |

Using data from U.S. presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall, basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy classification in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data.

However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chameleon: Taming Dynamic Operator Sequences for Memory-Intensive LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11076v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in memory requirements during training, often exceeding the capacity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Swap-based memory optimization incurs neither accuracy loss nor additional end-to-end overhead when effectively overlapped, thus being an attractive solution. However, existing swap methods assume consistent operator sequences, which is impractical in Eager Mode, where operator sequences can vary during change. We propose Chameleon, which redesigns the end-to-end process of swap-based memory optimization and is the first work to consider varying operator sequences in Eager Mode. Chameleon (i) introduces a lightweight online profiler to enable continuous profiling for monitoring operator sequences, (ii) generates effective swap policies with limited operator information, and (iii) optimizes the policy execution module for accurate policy application and better performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Chameleon reduces profiling overhead by 84.25%, enables training models up to 4x larger than hardware memory while adapting to changes in operator sequences, improves performance by up to 38.94% compared to recomputation or high-degree parallelism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Human Preference Evaluation of LLM Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11026v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales -- free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes. Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the XLLM-Reason-Plan Workshop on the Application of LLM Explainability to Reasoning and Planning at COLM 2025</p></details> |

To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task, ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CCKS ...</summary><p>CCKS 2025 Shared Task Paper</p></details> |

Knowledge Distillation for Goal-Oriented Dialogs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07238v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprises deploying LLMs for goal-oriented dialogs, such as customer service, face a critical trade-off between performance, control, and cost. Proprietary models like GPT-4 offer strong performance but are costly and cannot be self-hosted, raising security and privacy concerns. Open-source alternatives offer flexibility and lower token costs but lag in performance. We introduce Guidance Elicitation and Retrieval (GER), a prompt-based knowledge distillation framework where a high-performance teacher LLM coaches a lower-performance student without modifying the student's parameters. GER extracts tactical guidance for a wide range of dialog scenarios from the teacher and stores these scenario-guidance pairs in a structured library. At inference time, the student retrieves the relevant guidance and integrates it into its prompt. While GER training can be bootstrapped entirely with synthetic data, its modular design lets it seamlessly augment the synthetic data with human conversational logs. In addition, the modular design enables easy auditing and updating of the guidance library as new scenarios and constraints emerge. Experiments show GER's guidance-based coaching outperforms both example output based fine-tuning and non-customized guidance baselines, and generalizes across other contexts and student models. The GER framework is potentially extensible to coach human service agents.</p></details> |  |

They structure them in a psychologically plausible and validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.</p></details> |  |

This article presents an empirical investigation of failure modes in LLM-powered ML pipelines, based on an autopilot framework that orchestrates data preprocessing, model conversion, and on-device inference code generation. We show how prompt format, model behavior, and structural assumptions influence both success rates and failure characteristics, often in ways that standard validation pipelines fail to detect. Our analysis reveals a diverse set of error-prone behaviors, including format-induced misinterpretations and runtime-disruptive code that compiles but breaks downstream. We derive a taxonomy of failure categories and analyze errors across multiple LLMs, highlighting common root causes and systemic fragilities. Though grounded in specific devices, our study reveals broader challenges in LLM-based code generation. We conclude by discussing directions for improving reliability and traceability in LLM-powered embedded ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Computer (IEEE).

In this work, we argue for a stochastic method of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human quantifier scope interpretations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit risk preferences consistent with human expectations across different personas. Specifically, we assess whether LLM-generated responses reflect appropriate levels of risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior based on individual's persona. Our results reveal that while LLMs make reasonable decisions in simplified, personalized risk contexts, their performance declines in more complex economic decision-making tasks. To address this, we propose an alignment method designed to enhance LLM adherence to persona-specific risk preferences. Our approach improves the economic rationality of LLMs in risk-related applications, offering a step toward more human-aligned AI decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We define LLM dark patterns as manipulative or deceptive behaviors enacted in dialogue. Drawing on prior work and AI incident reports, we outline a diverse set of categories with real-world examples. Using them, we conducted a scenario-based study where participants (N=34) compared manipulative and neutral LLM responses. Our results reveal that recognition of LLM dark patterns often hinged on conversational cues such as exaggerated agreement, biased framing, or privacy intrusions, but these behaviors were also sometimes normalized as ordinary assistance. Users' perceptions of these dark patterns shaped how they respond to them. Responsibilities for these behaviors were also attributed in different ways, with participants assigning it to companies and developers, the model itself, or to users. We conclude with implications for design, advocacy, and governance to safeguard user autonomy.</p></details> |  |

The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models (LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages,4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A Turn-Wise Analysis of Iterative LLM Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06770v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation, code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task, utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns, vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation; speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late, elaborative iteration. Together, the framework and metrics make iteration measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or switch strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks, mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key directions for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrunchLLM: Multitask LLMs for Structured Business Reasoning and Outcome Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10698v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling, calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM Agents for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12110v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental monitoring, disaster management, climate science, and other scientific domains. Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

Yet little is known about how they negotiate and shape underlying values when reframing people's arguments on value-laden topics. We conducted experiments with 347 participants from India and the United States, who wrote constructive comments on homophobic and Islamophobic threads, and reviewed human-written and LLM-rewritten versions of these comments. Our analysis shows that LLM systematically diminishes Conservative values while elevating prosocial values such as Benevolence and Universalism. When these comments were read by others, participants opposing same-sex marriage or Islam found human-written comments more aligned with their values, whereas those supportive of these communities found LLM-rewritten versions more aligned with their values. These findings suggest that LLM-driven value homogenization can shape how diverse viewpoints are represented in contentious debates on value-laden topics and may influence the dynamics of online discourse critically.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPhO: How Far Are (M)LLMs from Humans in the Latest High School Physics Olympiad Benchmark?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07894v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with multiple golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight the performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong reasoning abilities of closed-source models, and the remaining room for improvement. HiPhO, a human-aligned Olympiad benchmark for multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO with a public leaderboard at https://phyarena.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Answer Needed: Predicting LLM Answer Accuracy from Question-Only Linear Probes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10625v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly? To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets, outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM internals.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefactorCoderQA: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Domain Coding Question Solutions in Cloud and Edge Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10436v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Better than Reported? Detecting Label Errors and Mitigating Their Effect on Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18889v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. We conduct a case study on four factual consistency datasets from the TRUE benchmark, spanning diverse NLP tasks, and on SummEval, which uses Likert-scale ratings of summary quality across multiple dimensions. We empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and LLM-based annotations in terms of the agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs' so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developer-LLM Conversations: An Empirical Study of Interactions and Generated Code Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10402v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to modern software development workflows, assisting developers with code generation, API explanation, and iterative problem-solving through natural language conversations. Despite widespread adoption, there is limited understanding of how developers interact with LLMs in practice and how these conversational dynamics influence task outcomes, code quality, and software engineering workflows. To address this, we leverage CodeChat, a large dataset comprising 82,845 real-world developer-LLM conversations, containing 368,506 code snippets generated across over 20 programming languages, derived from the WildChat dataset. We find that LLM responses are substantially longer than developer prompts, with a median token-length ratio of 14:1. Multi-turn conversations account for 68% of the dataset and often evolve due to shifting requirements, incomplete prompts, or clarification requests. Topic analysis identifies web design (9.6% of conversations) and neural network training (8.7% of conversations) as the most frequent LLM-assisted tasks. Evaluation across five languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and C#) reveals prevalent and language-specific issues in LLM-generated code: generated Python and JavaScript code often include undefined variables (83.4% and 75.3% of code snippets, respectively); Java code lacks required comments (75.9%); C++ code frequently omits headers (41.1%) and C# code shows unresolved namespaces (49.2%). During a conversation, syntax and import errors persist across turns; however, documentation quality in Java improves by up to 14.7%, and import handling in Python improves by 3.7% over 5 turns. Prompts that point out mistakes in code generated in prior turns and explicitly request a fix are most effective for resolving errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cut Costs, Not Accuracy: LLM-Powered Data Processing with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02896v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN, a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy, precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGMOD'26</p></details> |

However, though only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage, making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2025</p></details> |

This highlights the need for a versatile compute-memory efficient accelerator. Unfortunately, existing Transformer accelerators struggle to address both aspects simultaneously, as they focus on value-level processing, missing fine-grained opportunities to optimize computation and memory collaboratively. This paper introduces MCBP, a bit-grained compute-memory efficient algorithm-hardware co-design that leverages bit-slice (BS) enabled repetitiveness and sparsity to accelerate LLM inference. MCBP features three key innovations: 1) BS-repetitiveness-enabled computation reduction (BRCR), which eliminates redundant GEMM computations via leveraging redundancy hidden among BS vectors; 2) BS-sparsity-enabled two-state coding (BSTC), which reduces weight access via exploiting significant sparsity in high-order bit-slice weight; 3) Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP), which reduces KV cache access by leveraging early-termination-based bit-grained prediction. These techniques, supported by custom accelerator designs, effectively alleviate the burden in GEMM, weight access, and KV cache access. Extensive experiments on 26 benchmarks show that MCBP achieves 9.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia A100 GPU. Compared to SOTA Transformer accelerators, MCBP achieves 35x, 5.2x and 3.2x energy saving than Spatten, FACT and SOFA, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was not accepted, and its quality is not very good.

Structured around four pillars, i.e., Data, Algorithms, Human oversight, and Model Architecture, the framework bridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI capabilities in diverse SME applications. Ultimately, this paper offers a structured roadmap for responsible AI adoption, framing trust and ethics as a catalyst for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation in SMEs.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This working paper investigates how leading AI systems prioritize moral outcomes and what this reveals about the prospects for human-AI symbiosis. We address two central questions: (1) What moral values do state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) implicitly favour when confronted with dilemmas? (2) How do differences in model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability affect these moral preferences? To explore these questions, we conduct a quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18 dilemmas representing five moral frameworks. Our findings uncover strikingly consistent value biases. Across all models, Care and Virtue values outcomes were rated most moral, while libertarian choices were consistently penalized. Reasoning-enabled models exhibited greater sensitivity to context and provided richer explanations, whereas non-reasoning models produced more uniform but opaque judgments. This research makes three contributions: (i) Empirically, it delivers a large-scale comparison of moral reasoning across culturally distinct LLMs; (ii) Theoretically, it links probabilistic model behaviour with underlying value encodings; (iii) Practically, it highlights the need for explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI toward a transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on short pun-based jokes, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular form. We compare models' joke explanation abilities from simple puns to complex topical humour that requires esoteric knowledge of real-world entities and events. To this end, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (including reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most existing works on overly simple joke forms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects. The results provide evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way intelligibility in the design of human-machine systems.</p></details> |  |

Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used, which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16 frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and ranked in interpretable dimensions.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has explored AI-driven pentesting agents, but their evaluation relies on oversimplified capture-the-flag (CTF) settings that embed prior knowledge and reduce complexity, leading to performance estimates far from real-world practice. We close this gap by introducing the first real-world, agent-oriented pentesting benchmark, TermiBench, which shifts the goal from 'flag finding' to achieving full system control. The benchmark spans 510 hosts across 25 services and 30 CVEs, with realistic environments that require autonomous reconnaissance, discrimination between benign and exploitable services, and robust exploit execution. Using this benchmark, we find that existing systems can hardly obtain system shells under realistic conditions. To address these challenges, we propose TermiAgent, a multi-agent penetration testing framework. TermiAgent mitigates long-context forgetting with a Located Memory Activation mechanism and builds a reliable exploit arsenal via structured code understanding rather than naive retrieval. In evaluations, our work outperforms state-of-the-art agents, exhibiting stronger penetration testing capability, reducing execution time and financial cost, and demonstrating practicality even on laptop-scale deployments. Our work delivers both the first open-source benchmark for real-world autonomous pentesting and a novel agent framework that establishes a milestone for AI-driven penetration testing.</p></details> |  |

Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming random prediction baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</p></details> |  |

Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence.

| **[$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p></details> |  |

We present a human-in-the-loop (HITL) conceptual framework informed by theories of human web browsing behavior. The framework centers on an iterative loop in which the BUA proactively proposes next actions and the user steers the browsing process through feedback. It also distinguishes between exploration and exploitation actions, enabling users to control the breadth and depth of their browsing. Consequently, the framework aims to reduce users' physical and cognitive effort while preserving users' traditional browsing mental model and supporting users in achieving satisfactory outcomes. We illustrate how the framework operates with hypothetical use cases and discuss the shift from manual browsing to interaction-driven browsing. We contribute a theoretically informed conceptual framework for BUAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |

Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level understanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer visual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software systems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to evaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing approach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly from code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to standardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the first exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual documentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that combines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code and produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation framework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual documentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our approach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an improvement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation framework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual documentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding 0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual documentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid visual representations but also reliably assess their quality.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional code generation, these agents decompose goals, coordinate multi-step processes, and adapt based on feedback, reshaping software development practices. This survey provides a timely review of the field, introducing a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures and examining relevant techniques for planning, context management, tool integration, execution monitoring, and benchmarking datasets. We highlight challenges of this fast-moving field and discuss opportunities for building reliable, transparent, and collaborative coding agents.</p></details> |  |

Through a formative study (N=15), we found users frequently misunderstand agents' data practices, and desired unobtrusive, transparent data management. To achieve this, we designed and implemented PrivWeb, a trusted add-on on web agents that utilizes a localized LLM to anonymize private information on interfaces according to user preferences. It features privacy categorization schema and adaptive notifications that selectively pauses tasks for user control over information collection for highly sensitive information, while offering non-disruptive options for less sensitive information, minimizing human oversight. The user study (N=14) across travel, information retrieval, shopping, and entertainment tasks compared PrivWeb with baselines without notification and without control for private information access, where PrivWeb reduced perceived privacy risks with no associated increase in cognitive effort, and resulted in higher overall satisfaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoMem: Lifelong Memory Agent for Full-duplex Omnimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11914v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users' facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead. We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal, and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.</p></details> |  |

We propose integrating AI agents directly into collaborative writing environments. Our prototype makes AI use transparent and customisable through two new shared objects: agent profiles and tasks. Agent responses appear in the familiar comment feature. In a user study (N=30), 14 teams worked on writing projects during one week. Interaction logs and interviews show that teams incorporated agents into existing norms of authorship, control, and coordination, rather than treating them as team members. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory, while created agents and outputs became shared resources. We discuss implications for team-based AI interaction, highlighting opportunities and boundaries for treating AI as a shared resource in collaborative work.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While some of their content is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.</p></details> |  |

Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Demo)</p></details> |
| **[$ε$-Optimal Multi-Agent Patrol using Recurrent Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11640v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-agent patrol problem refers to repeatedly visiting different locations in an environment using multiple autonomous agents. For over two decades, researchers have studied this problem in various settings. While providing valuable insights into the problem, the works in existing literature have not commented on the nature of the optimal solutions to the problem. We first show that an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy exists for every feasible patrol strategy. Then, we establish the existence of a recurrent patrol strategy that is an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to the General Patrol Problem. The factor $\epsilon$ is proportional to the discretisation constant $D$, which can be arbitrarily small and is independent of the number of patrol agents and the size of the environment. This result holds for a variety of problem formulations already studied. We also provide an algorithmic approach to determine an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy for a patrol strategy created by any method from the literature. We perform extensive simulations in graphs based on real-life environments to validate the claims made in this work.</p></details> |  |

We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[VulAgent: Hypothesis-Validation based Multi-Agent Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11523v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of language models to project-level vulnerability detection remains challenging, owing to the dual requirement of accurately localizing security-sensitive code and correctly correlating and reasoning over complex program context. We present VulAgent, a multi-agent vulnerability detection framework based on hypothesis validation. Our design is inspired by how human auditors review code: when noticing a sensitive operation, they form a hypothesis about a possible vulnerability, consider potential trigger paths, and then verify the hypothesis against the surrounding context. VulAgent implements a semantics-sensitive, multi-view detection pipeline: specialized agents, each aligned to a specific analysis perspective (e.g., memory, authorization), collaboratively surface and precisely localize sensitive code sites with higher coverage. Building on this, VulAgent adopts a hypothesis-validation paradigm: for each vulnerability report, it builds hypothesis conditions and a trigger path, steering the LLM to target the relevant program context and defensive checks during verification, which reduces false positives. On average across the two datasets, VulAgent improves overall accuracy by 6.6%, increases the correct identification rate of vulnerable--fixed code pairs by up to 450% (246% on average), and reduces the false positive rate by about 36% compared with state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMATE: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16281v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/nlp2ct-shijie/HiMATE.</p></details> |  |

Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11507v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through conversation analysis (n=30), user surveys (n=19), and clinical validation against blinded specialist interviews (n=24). Symptoms detected by the agent aligned well with those identified by specialists across symptoms. Users appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. This preliminary work suggests conversational agents may serve as structured front-end tools for dementia assessment, highlighting interaction design considerations in sensitive healthcare contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.</p></details> |  |

We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees. Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks (recent progress has pushed the frontier further, with RepoMaster+Claude 3.5 achieving a new record of 62.96%). Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Highl...</summary><p>Highly practical, Well-motivated, Actionable</p></details> |

Users' Judgments of Virtual Agent Personality and Appeals in Encounters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11342v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating multi-sensory cues into Virtual Reality (VR) can significantly enhance user experiences, mirroring the multi-sensory interactions we encounter in the real-world. Olfaction plays a crucial role in shaping impressions when engaging with others. This study examines how non-verbal cues from virtual agents-specifically olfactory cues, emotional expressions, and gender-influence user perceptions during encounters with virtual agents. Our findings indicate that in unscented, woodsy, and floral scent conditions, participants primarily relied on visually observable cues to form their impressions of virtual agents. Positive emotional expressions, conveyed through facial expressions and gestures, contributed to more favorable impressions, with this effect being stronger for the female agent than the male agent. However, in the unpleasant scent condition, participants consistently formed negative impressions, which overpowered the influence of emotional expressions and gender, suggesting that aversive olfactory stimuli can detrimentally impact user perceptions. Our results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting olfactory stimuli when designing immersive and engaging VR interactions. Finally, we present our findings and outline future research directions for effectively integrating olfactory cues into virtual agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realistic Environmental Injection Attacks on GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11250v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites. However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model. To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4 representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to performance. Our findings reveal underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI agents and establish a robust foundation for future research on defense in open-world GUI agent systems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/attack2gui.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding, symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats, constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns. The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize, implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and reproducible deployment paths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Large Language Models for Music & Audio Workshop (LLM4MA) 2025</p></details> |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names, while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000 tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset, Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides an overview of the evolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents, highlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the entry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to advance the development of data agents into intelligent statistical analysis software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11079v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Agentic Lybic, a novel multi-agent system where the entire architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations, Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark, Agentic Lybic achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.</p></details> |  |

While learners can interact with academic papers through LLM-powered dialogue, limitations still exist: absence of structured organization and high text reliance can impede systematic understanding and engagement with complex concepts. To address these challenges, we propose Auto-Slides, an LLM-driven system that converts research papers into pedagogically structured, multimodal slides (e.g., diagrams and tables). Drawing on cognitive science, it creates a presentation-oriented narrative and allows iterative refinement via an interactive editor, in order to match learners' knowledge level and goals. Auto-Slides further incorporates verification and knowledge retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual completeness. Through extensive user studies, Auto-Slides enhances learners' comprehension and engagement compared to conventional LLM-based reading. Our contributions lie in designing a multi-agent framework for transforming academic papers into pedagogically optimized slides and introducing interactive customization for personalized learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages (main text: 16 pages, appendix: 10 pages), 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Free-MAD: Consensus-Free Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11035v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process, causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning performance. To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD} introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To investigate this emerging phenomenon, we conducted six design fiction workshops (n = 23) with managers and workers, in which participants co-created speculative scenarios and discussed how Manager Clone Agents might transform collaborative work. We identified four potential roles that participants envisioned for Manager Clone Agents: proxy presence, informational conveyor belt, productivity engine, and leadership amplifier, while highlighting concerns spanning individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. We provide design recommendations envisioned by both parties for integrating Manager Clone Agents responsibly into the future workplace, emphasizing the need to prioritize workers' perspectives, strengthen interpersonal bonds, and enable flexible clone configuration.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |
| **[An Agentic AI Workflow to Simplify Parameter Estimation of Complex Differential Equation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07283v3)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter identification for mechanistic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models underpins prediction and control in several applications, yet remains a manual and labor-intensive process: datasets are noisy and partial, models can be stiff and complex, and differentiable implementations demand framework expertise. An agentic AI workflow is presented that converts a lightweight, human-readable specification into a compiled, parallel, and differentiable model calibration pipeline. Users supply an XML description of the problem and fill in a Python code skeleton; the agent automatically validates consistency between problem definition and code, and auto-corrects pathologies in the input deck. It transforms Python callables into pure JAX functions for efficient just-in-time compilation and parallelization. The system then orchestrates a two-stage search comprising global exploration of the parameter space followed by gradient-based refinement. The result is an AD-native, reproducible workflow that lowers the barrier to advanced calibration while preserving expert control. An open-source implementation with a documented API and examples is released, enabling rapid movement from problem statement to interpretable ODE models with minimal effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMMA: A Communicative Multimodal Multi-Agent Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07553v4)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p></details> |  |

Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication. The code supporting this work is available at https://github.com/Manishms18/Adaptive-Multi-Dimensional-Monitoring.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p></details> |  |

Previous video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces, leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |

Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables (22 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, and more. Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. For example, when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90\% of trials (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100\%. We also demonstrate that these attacks succeed even if individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions. We hope that these results will motivate development of trust and security models for multi-agent systems before they are widely deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, designing reward functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative approaches never witness a single successful trial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website with videos https://chirayu-n.github.io/gcmarl and code https://github.com/Chirayu-N/gc-marl are online</p></details> |

Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

| **[Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore, different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents, such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALRPHFS: Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast \& Slow Reasoning for Robust Agent Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19260v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM Agents are becoming central to intelligent systems. However, their deployment raises serious safety concerns. Existing defenses largely rely on "Safety Checks", which struggle to capture the complex semantic risks posed by harmful user inputs or unsafe agent behaviors - creating a significant semantic gap between safety checks and real-world risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel defense framework, ALRPHFS (Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast & Slow Reasoning). ALRPHFS consists of two core components: (1) an offline adversarial self-learning loop to iteratively refine a generalizable and balanced library of risk patterns, substantially enhancing robustness without retraining the base LLM, and (2) an online hierarchical fast & slow reasoning engine that balances detection effectiveness with computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared to existing baselines, achieving a best-in-class average accuracy of 80% and exhibiting strong generalizability across agents and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 findings, 20 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[DeepDive: Advancing Deep Search Agents with Knowledge Graphs and Multi-Turn RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10446v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.</p></details> |  |
| **[DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecoWorld: Building Simulated Environments for Agentic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10397v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RecoWorld, a blueprint for building simulated environments tailored to agentic recommender systems. Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot guide with multi-agent control and automatic scenario generation with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10317v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The work describes the development of a hybrid control architecture for an anthropomorphic tour guide robot, combining a multi-agent resource management system with automatic behavior scenario generation based on large language models. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions, as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for automating and scaling social robot control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 demo-video and repository link</p></details> |

| **[A Holistic Architecture for Monitoring and Optimization of Robust Multi-Agent Path Finding Plan Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10284v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a fleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their goals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots executing the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk. Although robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the presence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the duration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become significant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the original plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan which will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide when to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this paper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans, its monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called Action Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution duration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the potential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We empirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator which we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous warehouse robotic fleet.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10222v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fully Automated Molecular Simulations: Multi-Agent Framework for Simulation Setup and Force Field Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10210v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated characterization of porous materials has the potential to accelerate materials discovery, but it remains limited by the complexity of simulation setup and force field selection. We propose a multi-agent framework in which LLM-based agents can autonomously understand a characterization task, plan appropriate simulations, assemble relevant force fields, execute them and interpret their results to guide subsequent steps. As a first step toward this vision, we present a multi-agent system for literature-informed force field extraction and automated RASPA simulation setup. Initial evaluations demonstrate high correctness and reproducibility, highlighting this approach's potential to enable fully autonomous, scalable materials characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving and Energy-Aware Resource Management in 6G Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10163v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility, and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G edge networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Agent Economies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10147v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct human oversight. We propose the "sandbox economy" as a framework for analyzing this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins (emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy, presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the design of AI "mission economies" to coordinate around achieving collective goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's long-term collective flourishing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tangential Action Spaces: Geometry, Memory and Cost in Holonomic and Nonholonomic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03399v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living systems balance energetic efficiency with the capacity for path-dependent effects. We introduce Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a geometric framework that models embodied agents as hierarchies of manifolds linked by projections from physical states to cognitive representations and onward to intentions. Lifts from intentions back to actions may follow multiple routes that differ in energy cost and in whether they leave memory-like traces. Under explicit assumptions, we prove: (i) if the physical-to-cognitive map is locally invertible, there is a unique lift that minimises instantaneous energy and yields no path-dependent memory; any memory requires strictly positive excess energy. (ii) If multiple physical states map to a cognitive state (a fibration), the energy-minimising lift is the metric-weighted pseudoinverse of the projection. (iii) In systems with holonomy, excess energy grows quadratically with the size of the induced memory for sufficiently small loops, establishing a local cost-memory law. These results motivate a classification of embodied systems by the origin of path dependence: intrinsically conservative, conditionally conservative, geometrically nonconservative, and dynamically nonconservative. Numerical examples illustrate each case. We also present a reflective extension (rTAS) in which perception depends on a learnable model state; a block metric formalises an effort-learning trade-off, and cross-curvature terms couple physical and model holonomy. Simulations of single- and two-agent settings show role asymmetries and sensitivity to coupling. TAS provides a geometric language linking embodiment, memory, and energetic cost, yielding testable predictions and design guidelines for biological and robotic systems.</p></details> | 41 pages, 16 figures |
| **[XAgents: A Unified Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation via IF-THEN Rules and Multipolar Task Processing Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10054v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in supporting humans with complex, real-world tasks. However, MAS still face challenges in effective task planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often resulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To address this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework built on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the multipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle task uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance inter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three distinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks. The codes for XAgents are available at: https://github.com/AGI-FHBC/XAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring a Gamified Personality Assessment Method through Interaction with LLM Agents Embodying Different Personalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04005v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The low-intrusion and automated personality assessment is receiving increasing attention in psychology and human-computer interaction fields. This study explores an interactive approach for personality assessment, focusing on the multiplicity of personality representation. We propose a framework of Gamified Personality Assessment through Multi-Personality Representations (Multi-PR GPA). The framework leverages Large Language Models to empower virtual agents with different personalities. These agents elicit multifaceted human personality representations through engaging in interactive games. Drawing upon the multi-type textual data generated throughout the interaction, it achieves two modes of personality assessment (i.e., Direct Assessment and Questionnaire-based Assessment) and provides interpretable insights. Grounded in the classic Big Five personality theory, we developed a prototype system and conducted a user study to evaluate the efficacy of Multi-PR GPA. The results affirm the effectiveness of our approach in personality assessment and demonstrate its superior performance when considering the multiplicity of personality representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoJSON Agents:A Multi-Agent LLM Architecture for Geospatial Analysis-Function Calling vs Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08863v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language understanding. However, without expertise in GIS, they continue to encounter limitations. To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent LLM architecture. This framework transforms natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture consists of three components-task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance and scalability of GIS automation. The Planner agent interprets natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON commands. Then, specialized Worker agents collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and analysis, either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code. Finally, the system integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON files. To systematically evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70 tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model. Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%, while the Code Generation-based agent reached 97.14%, both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%). Further analysis reveals that the Code Generation provides greater flexibility, whereas the Function Calling approach offers more stable execution. This study is the first to introduce an LLM multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods, offering new perspectives for improving GeoAI system performance.</p></details> |  |

High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote servers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely utilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system (GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and protects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space, agents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data is utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused by anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public question-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The results demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models. To further assess its privacy-preserving capabilities, we designed two new datasets: Knowledge Privacy Preservation and Logic Privacy Preservation. The final results highlight GAMA's exceptional effectiveness in both task processing and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature". We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a three-phase methodology that combines LLM-based firmware generation with automated security validation and iterative refinement in a virtualized environment. Using structured prompts, models like GPT-4 generate firmware for networking and control tasks, deployed on FreeRTOS via QEMU. These implementations are tested using fuzzing, static analysis, and runtime monitoring to detect vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows (CWE-120), race conditions (CWE-362), and denial-of-service threats (CWE-400). Specialized AI agents for Threat Detection, Performance Optimization, and Compliance Verification collaborate to improve detection and remediation. Identified issues are categorized using CWE, then used to prompt targeted LLM-generated patches in an iterative loop. Experiments show a 92.4\% Vulnerability Remediation Rate (37.3\% improvement), 95.8\% Threat Model Compliance, and 0.87 Security Coverage Index. Real-time metrics include 8.6ms worst-case execution time and 195{\mu}s jitter. This process enhances firmware security and performance while contributing an open-source dataset for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996v5)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are therefore understood as systems that perceive their environment and execute pre-programmed tasks independently of external input, consistent with the SAE levels of automated driving. Yet recent research and real-world deployments have begun to showcase vehicles that exhibit behaviors outside the scope of this definition. These include natural language interaction with humans, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and the handling of unforeseen ethical dilemmas, enabled in part by multimodal large language models (LLMs). These developments highlight not only a gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capacities required for human-centered mobility, but also the emergence of a form of vehicle intelligence that currently lacks a clear designation. To address this gap, the paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs): vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. It synthesizes recent advances in agentic systems and suggests how AgVs can complement and even reshape conventional autonomy to ensure mobility services are aligned with user and societal needs. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs and their potential role in shaping future agentic transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciML Agents: Write the Solver, Not the Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09936v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff), and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems; and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open- and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving simple ODE problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The (R)evolution of Scientific Workflows in the Agentic AI Era: Towards Autonomous Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09915v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery increasingly requires coordinating distributed facilities and heterogeneous resources, forcing researchers to act as manual workflow coordinators rather than scientists. Advances in AI leading to AI agents show exciting new opportunities that can accelerate scientific discovery by providing intelligence as a component in the ecosystem. However, it is unclear how this new capability would materialize and integrate in the real world. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework where workflows evolve along two dimensions which are intelligence (from static to intelligent) and composition (from single to swarm) to chart an evolutionary path from current workflow management systems to fully autonomous, distributed scientific laboratories. With these trajectories in mind, we present an architectural blueprint that can help the community take the next steps towards harnessing the opportunities in autonomous science with the potential for 100x discovery acceleration and transformational scientific workflows.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates how personality expression levels and user-agent personality alignment influence perceptions in goal-oriented tasks. In a between-subjects experiment (N=150), participants completed travel planning with CAs exhibiting low, medium, or high expression across the Big Five traits, controlled via our novel Trait Modulation Keys framework. Results revealed an inverted-U relationship: medium expression produced the most positive evaluations across Intelligence, Enjoyment, Anthropomorphism, Intention to Adopt, Trust, and Likeability, significantly outperforming both extremes. Personality alignment further enhanced outcomes, with Extraversion and Emotional Stability emerging as the most influential traits. Cluster analysis identified three distinct compatibility profiles, with "Well-Aligned" users reporting substantially positive perceptions. These findings demonstrate that personality expression and strategic trait alignment constitute optimal design targets for CA personality, offering design implications as LLM-based CAs become increasingly prevalent.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as Agentic Cooperative Players in Multiplayer UNO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09867v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs promise to assist humans -- not just by answering questions, but by offering useful guidance across a wide range of tasks. But how far does that assistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone accomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by engaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but instead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts performance. We find that while all models were able to successfully outperform a random baseline when playing UNO, few were able to significantly aid another player.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Effi: Re-Evaluating Software AI Agent System Effectiveness Under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09853v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the "token snowball" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of "expensive failures". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demo: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) for Patient Summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure; Added missing co-authors and contributors</p></details> |

We present a $2$-approximation algorithm when the two utility functions are normalized, improving the previous best ratio of $16 \sqrt{n}$ shown for general normalized utility functions; thus this constant ratio approximation algorithm confirms the APX-completeness in this special case previously shown APX-hard. When there are only three agents, i.e., $n = 3$, the previous best ratio is $3$ shown for general utility functions, and we present an improved and tight $\frac 53$-approximation algorithm when the two utility functions are normalized, and a best possible and tight $2$-approximation algorithm when the two utility functions are unnormalized.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version appears in ISAAC 2025; 20 pages in this full version</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the Capability Gap: Joint Alignment Tuning for Harmonizing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09629v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Boosting Embodied AI Agents through Perception-Generation Disaggregation and Asynchronous Pipeline Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09560v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combating the Memory Walls: Optimization Pathways for Long-Context Agentic LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09505v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs now form the backbone of AI agents for a diverse array of applications, including tool use, command-line agents, and web or computer use agents. These agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex, prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization. In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers 2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA system will also be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</p></details> |  |

The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

To address the time-consuming manual effort required for scholarly discovery, we present a novel, fully automated system that transitions from data discovery to direct action. Our pipeline demonstrates how a specialized AI agent, 'Agent-E', can be tasked with identifying papers from specific geographic regions within conference proceedings and then executing a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to complete a predefined action, such as submitting a nomination form. We validated our system on 586 papers from five different conferences, where it successfully identified every target paper with a recall of 100% and a near perfect accuracy of 99.4%. This demonstration highlights the potential of task-oriented AI agents to not only filter information but also to actively participate in and accelerate the workflows of the academic community.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities (e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite, Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative studies.</p></details> |  |

However, substantial challenges remain in designing versatile, robust, and efficient platforms for agent deployment. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{LightAgent}, a lightweight yet powerful agentic framework, effectively resolving the trade-off between flexibility and simplicity found in existing frameworks. LightAgent integrates core functionalities such as Memory (mem0), Tools, and Tree of Thought (ToT), while maintaining an extremely lightweight structure. As a fully open-source solution, it seamlessly integrates with mainstream chat platforms, enabling developers to easily build self-learning agents.

| **[Harnessing Uncertainty: Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09265v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Completeness of coalition logics with seriality, independence of agents, or determinism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14635v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coalition Logic is a central logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In a recent paper, Li and Ju argued that generally, models of Coalition Logic, concurrent game models, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented a Minimal Coalition Logic based on general concurrent game models, which do not have the three assumptions. However, when constructing coalition logics about strategic reasoning in special kinds of situations, we may want to keep some of the assumptions. Thus, studying coalition logics with some of these assumptions makes good sense. In this paper, we show the completeness of these coalition logics in a uniform way.</p></details> |  |

While these agents offer significant opportunities across domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration, comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability, (ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Recent advancements have extended prediction techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments. We hope this work will benefit the research community with a neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page can be found at Github.</p></details> | 54 pages, journal |

These agents allow users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA deterministically ensures that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before executing the action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification. This enables runtime, rule-based verification of agent's actions, detecting erroneous actions even before they take effect. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agents, bridging the gap between LFM-driven actions and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LFM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.33%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, outperforming existing LFM-based verification methods by 30.00%-16.33%, and increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
