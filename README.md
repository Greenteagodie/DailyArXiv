| **[Hierarchical Learning-Based Control for Multi-Agent Shepherding of Stochastic Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02632v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent shepherding represents a challenging distributed control problem where herder agents must coordinate to guide independently moving targets to desired spatial configurations. Most existing control strategies assume cohesive target behavior, which frequently fails in practical applications where targets exhibit stochastic autonomous behavior. This paper presents a hierarchical learning-based control architecture that decomposes the shepherding problem into a high-level decision-making module and a low-level motion control component. The proposed distributed control system synthesizes effective control policies directly from closed-loop experience without requiring explicit inter-agent communication or prior knowledge of target dynamics. The decentralized architecture achieves cooperative control behavior through emergent coordination without centralized supervision. Experimental validation demonstrates superior closed-loop performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic control methods, achieving 100\% success rates with improved settling times and control efficiency. The control architecture scales beyond its design conditions, adapts to time-varying goal regions, and demonstrates practical implementation feasibility through real-time experiments on the Robotarium platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCodePolicy: Hybrid Language Controllers for Multimodal Monitoring and Decision in Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02629v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents. However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop on Multi-Modal Reasoning for Agentic Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[HealthFlow: A Self-Evolving AI Agent with Meta Planning for Autonomous Healthcare Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02621v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yhzhu99/HealthFlow</p></details> |
| **[AIAP: A No-Code Workflow Builder for Non-Experts with Natural Language and Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02470v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity. We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers and enhances user experience in AI service design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Emergence of Fair Leaders via Mediators in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02421v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents' returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control, such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control (leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall fairness in agents' returns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Medical Triage under Uncertainty: A Multi-Agent Dynamic Matching Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22504v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on medical triage systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: inadequate medical specialization leading to misclassification, heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions. Our system employs three specialized agents--RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent, and DepartmentAgent--that collaborate through Inquiry Guidance mechanism and Classification Guidance Mechanism to transform unstructured patient symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation, we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from "Ai Ai Yi Medical Network", comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and 62 secondary departments. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent system achieves 89.6% accuracy in primary department classification and 74.3% accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient interaction. The system's dynamic matching based guidance mechanisms enable efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high triage accuracy. We successfully developed this multi-agent triage system that not only adapts to organizational heterogeneity across healthcare institutions but also ensures clinically sound decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 2 table</p></details> |
| **[Talking Surveys: How Photorealistic Embodied Conversational Agents Shape Response Quality, Engagement, and Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02376v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly more realistic and capable of dynamic conversations. In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability. However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions. These findings support the pursuit and development of new methods toward human-like agents for the transformation of online surveys into more natural interactions resembling in-person interviews.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Personalized Fashion Recommendation in the Age of Generative AI: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02342v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users, brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and modeling challenges that arise. We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test Amplification for REST APIs via Single and Multi-Agent LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08113v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) play a vital role in modern cloud-native applications. As these APIs grow in complexity and scale, ensuring their correctness and robustness becomes increasingly important. Automated testing is essential for identifying hidden bugs, particularly those that appear in edge cases or under unexpected inputs. However, creating comprehensive and effective test suites for REST APIs is challenging and often demands significant effort. In this paper, we investigate the use of large language model (LLM) systems, both single-agent and multi-agent setups, for amplifying existing REST API test suites. These systems generate additional test cases that aim to push the boundaries of the API, uncovering behaviors that might otherwise go untested. We present a comparative evaluation of the two approaches across several dimensions, including test coverage, bug detection effectiveness, and practical considerations such as computational cost and energy usage. Our evaluation demonstrates increased API coverage, identification of numerous bugs in the API under test, and insights into the computational cost and energy consumption of both approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via Matrix-Valued Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02289v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e., leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling transformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to demonstrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[CellForge: Agentic Design of Virtual Cell Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02276v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed AI Agents for Cognitive Underwater Robot Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23735v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex, unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios, environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse array of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whispering Agents: An event-driven covert communication protocol for the Internet of Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02188v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens, establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols for a secure and trustworthy IoA.</p></details> |  |
| **[ME-IGM: Individual-Global-Max in Maximum Entropy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13930v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent credit assignment is a fundamental challenge for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where a team of agents learn from shared reward signals. The Individual-Global-Max (IGM) condition is a widely used principle for multi-agent credit assignment, requiring that the joint action determined by individual Q-functions maximizes the global Q-value. Meanwhile, the principle of maximum entropy has been leveraged to enhance exploration in MARL. However, we identify a critical limitation in existing maximum entropy MARL methods: a misalignment arises between local policies and the joint policy that maximizes the global Q-value, leading to violations of the IGM condition. To address this misalignment, we propose an order-preserving transformation. Building on it, we introduce ME-IGM, a novel maximum entropy MARL algorithm compatible with any credit assignment mechanism that satisfies the IGM condition while enjoying the benefits of maximum entropy exploration. We empirically evaluate two variants of ME-IGM: ME-QMIX and ME-QPLEX, in non-monotonic matrix games, and demonstrate their state-of-the-art performance across 17 scenarios in SMAC-v2 and Overcooked.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evolving Scenario Generation Method based on Dual-modal Driver Model Trained by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02027v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[GEM: Gaussian Embedding Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Detection in GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12842v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline while only increasing training time by 4.9\% and testing time by 6.5\%. We also experimentally demonstrate that GEM can improve the step-wise success rate by 9.40\% by requesting assistance from the cloud model when encountering OOD samples. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Group Consensus-Driven Auction Algorithm for Cooperative Task Allocation Among Heterogeneous Multi-Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02015v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scenarios like automated warehouses, assigning tasks to robots presents a heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation problem. However, existing task allocation study ignores the integration of multi-task and multi-attribute agent task allocation with heterogeneous task allocation. In addition, current algorithms are limited by scenario constraints and can incur significant errors in specific contexts. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation algorithm with a time window, called group consensus-based heterogeneous auction (GCBHA). Firstly, this method decomposes tasks that exceed the capability of a single Agent into subtasks that can be completed by multiple independent agents. And then groups similar or adjacent tasks through a heuristic clustering method to reduce the time required to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the task groups are allocated to agents that meet the conditions through an auction process. Furthermore, the method evaluates the task path cost distance based on the scenario, which can calculate the task cost more accurately. The experimental results demonstrate that GCBHA performs well in terms of task allocation time and solution quality, with a significant reduction in the error rate between predicted task costs and actual costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpeechRole: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Evaluating Speech Role-Playing Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02013v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing research and to foster further developments in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01956v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web-CogReasoner: Towards Knowledge-Induced Cognitive Reasoning for Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01858v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains such as the circular economy, where information about classifications, processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval, query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and 527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model (Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable and reproducible research on agent capabilities.

| **[Bayes-Entropy Collaborative Driven Agents for Research Hypotheses Generation and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01746v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes' theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12 optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Xiaowei Shao. 12 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Chain-of-Agents for Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01696v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at https://github.com/liunian-Jay/CoCoA</p></details> |

The platform is designed to analyze and compare the reasoning, adaptability, and tactical depth exhibited by different LLMs in a type-based, turn-based combat environment. By structuring the competition as a single-elimination tournament involving diverse AI trainers, the system captures detailed decision logs, including team-building rationale, action selection strategies, and switching decisions. The project enables rich exploration into comparative AI behavior, battle psychology, and meta-strategy development in constrained, rule-based game environments. Through this system, we investigate how modern LLMs understand, adapt, and optimize decisions under uncertainty, making Pok\'emon League a novel benchmark for AI research in strategic reasoning and competitive learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework For Enhancing Decision-Making In Machine Learning Models Using External Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01612v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model, identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere. The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, 274 pages, 8 Tables, 73 figures</p></details> |

Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches, Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over 1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.</p></details> |  |

We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual intervention; (3) 14$\times$ storage reduction (1.4GB $\rightarrow$ 102MB per instance) via intelligent dependency management and image pruning; (4) $>$70\% faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL pipeline bottlenecks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Strategy Adaptation in Multi-Agent Environments with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02002v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate, communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05 milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Gossip Protocols: A Vision for Emergent Coordination in Agentic Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01531v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination. Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness, and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient, reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01522v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

This very comprehensiveness creates a challenge for interpretation, as audiences typically possess specialized knowledge related to their expertise, age, or standpoint. Consequently, a reader might fully understand the financial implications of a story but fail to grasp or even actively misunderstand its legal or technological dimensions, resulting in critical comprehension gaps. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences' understanding of news content, particularly in the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose MADES, an agent-based framework designed to simulate societal communication. The framework utilizes diverse agents, each configured to represent a specific occupation or age group. Each agent is equipped with a memory system. These agents are then simulated to discuss the news. This process enables us to monitor and analyze their behavior and cognitive processes. Our findings indicate that the framework can identify confusions and misunderstandings within news content through its iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identifications, the framework then designs supplementary material. We validated these outcomes using both statistical analysis and human evaluation, and the results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[WinkTPG: An Execution Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01495v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Map and Agent Geometry for Autonomous Driving Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13922v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, deep learning enabled motion prediction is a popular topic. A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Broad, Act Narrow: CWE Identification with Multi-Agent Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01451v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\% of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, it is still a niche topic that is not directly supported by any of the major reinforcement learning libraries. These methods can improve the capabilities and generalization of RL agents, but often require complex changes to training code. We introduce Syllabus, a portable curriculum learning library, as a solution to this problem. Syllabus provides a universal API for curriculum learning, modular implementations of popular automatic curriculum learning methods, and infrastructure that allows them to be easily integrated with asynchronous training code in nearly any RL library. Syllabus provides a minimal API for core curriculum learning components, making it easier to design new algorithms and adapt existing ones to new environments. We demonstrate this by evaluating the algorithms in Syllabus on several new environments, each using agents written in a different RL library. We present the first examples of automatic curriculum learning in NetHack and Neural MMO, two of the most challenging RL benchmarks, and find evidence that existing methods do not directly transfer to complex new environments. Syllabus can be found at https://github.com/RyanNavillus/Syllabus.</p></details> | RLC 2025 |

These agents learn from real professional consultants' presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7 minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to automatically create affordable market insights.</p></details> |  |

As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This book provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within modular, brain-inspired architectures that integrate principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we systematically investigate the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, goal, and emotion. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms. Third, we examine multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from different disciplines, this survey identifies key research challenges and opportunities, encouraging innovations that harmonize technological advancement with meaningful societal benefit.</p></details> |  |

Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[NatureGAIA: Pushing the Frontiers of GUI Agents with a Challenging Benchmark and High-Quality Trajectory Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01330v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception, decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the future development of GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01293v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages main content + 11 pages appendices</p></details> |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[VerificAgent: Domain-Specific Memory Verification for Scalable Oversight of Aligned Computer-Use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02539v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual memory augmentation lets computer-using agents (CUAs) learn from prior interactions, but unvetted memories can encode domain-inappropriate or unsafe heuristics--spurious rules that drift from user intent and safety constraints. We introduce VerificAgent, a scalable oversight framework that treats persistent memory as an explicit alignment surface. VerificAgent combines (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory growth during training, and (3) a post-hoc human fact-checking pass to sanitize accumulated memories before deployment. Evaluated on OSWorld productivity tasks and additional adversarial stress tests, VerificAgent improves task reliability, reduces hallucination-induced failures, and preserves interpretable, auditable guidance--without additional model fine-tuning. By letting humans correct high-impact errors once, the verified memory acts as a frozen safety contract that future agent actions must satisfy. Our results suggest that domain-scoped, human-verified memory offers a scalable oversight mechanism for CUAs, complementing broader alignment strategies by limiting silent policy drift and anchoring agent behavior to the norms and safety constraints of the target domain.</p></details> |  |

These agents dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration, external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles, orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20 representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow infrastructure, and safe automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IEEE Conference, ICAIBD(International Conference of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data) 2025.

| **[MARS: A Meta-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Portfolio Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01173v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold, allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble. By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria, significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep understanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses these challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an artificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on refining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving accessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining AI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective, and engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCoDe: Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Constraint Design for Multi-Agent Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19151v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CoRL 2025</p></details> |

Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures |

At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable software release decisions is critical in safety-critical domains such as automotive manufacturing. Release validation relies on large tabular datasets, yet manual analysis is slow, costly, and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential, they face challenges in analytical reasoning, structured data handling, and ambiguity resolution. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration. This work advances deployable LLM system design by identifying key architectural features-intermediate formal representations, execution efficiency, and low configuration overhead-crucial for safety-critical industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centralized Adaptive Sampling for Reliable Co-Training of Independent Multi-Agent Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01049v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games, but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution. This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.</p></details> |  |

To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01005v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework. Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on https://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.</p></details> | 51 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00743v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Game Generation and Evaluation via Audio-Visual Recordings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00632v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging. Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a multi-agent system. We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video, and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies good from broken or mismatched content. We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback from the AVR. We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However, models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental differences between human and machine content creation approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. Furthermore, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable and robust evaluation; (2) finance oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of tasks in the domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReaGAN: Node-as-Agent-Reasoning Graph Agentic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00429v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |

However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

| **[Theory of Mind Using Active Inference: A Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00401v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication, while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts. Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.</p></details> |  |

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Recent advances in this area focus on closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing embellishing control over intentions and driving styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

While test-time computation offers a path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured, self-constructed task reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM Dataset Track 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Wireless Multi-Agent System (WMAS), which can provide intelligent and customized services for different user equipment (UEs). Note that orchestrating multiple agents carries the risk of malfunction, and multi-agent conversations may fall into infinite loops. It is thus crucial to design a conversation topology for WMAS that enables agents to complete UE task requests with high accuracy and low conversation overhead. To address this issue, we model the multi-agent conversation topology as a directed acyclic graph and propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize the adjacency matrix of this graph. As such, WMAS is capable of generating and self-optimizing multi-agent conversation topologies, enabling agents to effectively and collaboratively handle a variety of task requests from UEs. Simulation results across various task types demonstrate that WMAS can achieve higher task performance and lower conversation overhead compared to existing multi-agent systems. These results validate the potential of WMAS to enhance the intelligence of future wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

At each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent(s) from a prespecified message space. The designer may also take an action that directly influences system dynamics and rewards. Each agent uses its received message (and its own information) to choose its action. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to incentivize each agent to play a specific strategy. We consider a notion of incentive compatibility that is based on sequential rationality at each realization of the common information between the designer and the agent(s). Our objective is to find a messaging and action strategy for the designer that maximizes its total expected reward while incentivizing each agent to follow a prespecified strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the problem, we show that an optimal designer strategy can be computed using a backward inductive algorithm that solves a family of linear programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>We su...</summary><p>We submitted a full paper to IEEE TAC for review.

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[SimuRA: Towards General Goal-Oriented Agent via Simulative Reasoning Architecture with LLM-Based World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.</p></details> |  |

Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data. On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic. This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession swaps).</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Scalable Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Spatial Intelligence in Visuomotor Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23698v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.

| **[Barriers to Healthcare: Agent-Based Modeling to Mitigate Inequity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23644v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based simulations have an enormous potential as tools to evaluate social policies in a non-invasive way, before these are implemented to real-world populations. However, the recommendations that these computational approaches may offer to tackle urgent human development challenges can vary substantially depending on how we model agents' (people) behaviour and the criteria that we use to measure inequity. In this paper, we integrate the conceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly designed to promote and assess human well-being, to guide the simulation and evaluate the effectiveness of policies. We define a reinforcement learning environment where agents behave to restore their capabilities under the constraints of a specific policy. Working in collaboration with local stakeholders, non-profits and domain experts, we apply our model in a case study to mitigate health inequity among the population experiencing homelessness (PEH) in Barcelona. By doing so, we present the first proof of concept simulation, aligned with the CA for human development, to assess the impact of policies under parliamentary discussion.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory Network for Multi-modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02479v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060v5)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at https://misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com/.</p></details> |  |

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on developing datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting model robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To address, we introduce "Miscaption This!", a collection of LVLM-generated miscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better to real-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD.

Lacking robust automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation generation to low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.</p></details> |  |

This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information.

To control their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative, inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second, the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Consistent and Invariant Generalization Learning for Short-video Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04061v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model.

| **[Towards Explainable Bilingual Multimodal Misinformation Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22930v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain. This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and other low-moderation social platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, only a few studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR). The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.</p></details> |  |

Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion.

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |

This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Large Language Models for Misinformation Detection in Low-Resource Linguistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01587v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning Based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively. This project is available at https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debate-to-Detect: Reformulating Misinformation Detection as a Real-World Debate with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18596v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |
| **[CAMOUFLAGE: Exploiting Misinformation Detection Systems Through LLM-driven Adversarial Claim Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01900v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically.

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

| **[Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unmasking Digital Falsehoods: A Comparative Analysis of LLM-Based Misinformation Detection Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00724v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MMFakeBench: A Mixed-Source Multimodal Misinformation Detection Benchmark for LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08772v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) methods often assume a single source and type of forgery for each sample, which is insufficient for real-world scenarios where multiple forgery sources coexist. The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Machine Learning for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12215v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD) Journal.

We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.

This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection.

A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |

Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Examination on the Effectiveness of Divide-and-Conquer Prompting in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05359v6)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMMA: Towards LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11943v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant challenges for individuals and societies. Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Missci: Reconstructing Fallacies in Misrepresented Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03181v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |
| **[Early Detection of Misinformation for Infodemic Management: A Domain Adaptation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10238v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An infodemic refers to an enormous amount of true information and misinformation disseminated during a disease outbreak. Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Capabilities of LLMs across Scale and Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03146v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying misleading versus non-misleading news headlines. Utilizing a dataset of 60 articles, sourced from both reputable and questionable outlets across health, science & tech, and business domains, we employ three LLMs- ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini-for classification. Our analysis reveals significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human judgment. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI ethics, emphasizing the need for models that are not only technically advanced but also ethically aligned and sensitive to the subtleties of human interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 tables, 1st HEAL Workshop at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 12, Honolulu, HI, USA 2024</p></details> |

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective. Additionally, we provide a dataset on health misinformation, thoroughly annotated by experts utilizing our proposed scheme. Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-CoLING-2024</p></details> |

However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st Workshop on Multilingual Data Quality Signals, COLM 2025, Short paper. 10 pages in total</p></details> |

While generative models offer a solution, traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data, leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture. First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.</p></details> |  |

We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Nikla...</summary><p>Niklas Pfister, V\'aclav Volhejn and Manuel Knott contributed equally</p></details> |

Training CNNs to Classify and Localize Memorization in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02573v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy and the attention weights involved in decoding. We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories: memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights involved in each form of memorization.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists, AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.</p></details> |  |

We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain unreliable and often depend on iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to 92\% on the most complex problems.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, the first evaluation benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., conceptual or empirical focus), which are more subjective and abstract. We conduct extensive experiments using various large language models (LLMs) under various settings, including in-context learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and two-stage modular methods for balancing control over different attributes. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs capabilities in balancing trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2025 SciSoc LLM Workshop: Large Language Models for Scientific and Societal Advances</p></details> |

Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02381v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .</p></details> |  |

These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent preferences of models and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

As these APIs grow in complexity and scale, ensuring their correctness and robustness becomes increasingly important. Automated testing is essential for identifying hidden bugs, particularly those that appear in edge cases or under unexpected inputs. However, creating comprehensive and effective test suites for REST APIs is challenging and often demands significant effort. In this paper, we investigate the use of large language model (LLM) systems, both single-agent and multi-agent setups, for amplifying existing REST API test suites. These systems generate additional test cases that aim to push the boundaries of the API, uncovering behaviors that might otherwise go untested. We present a comparative evaluation of the two approaches across several dimensions, including test coverage, bug detection effectiveness, and practical considerations such as computational cost and energy usage. Our evaluation demonstrates increased API coverage, identification of numerous bugs in the API under test, and insights into the computational cost and energy consumption of both approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current RLVR methods typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning (RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm \citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/saharsamr/Modular-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main conference, short paper), 10 pages</p></details> |

However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood. Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15 methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies. Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps, each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies, providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.</p></details> |  |

Supporting reminiscence in older adults through technological implementations is becoming an increasingly important area of research in the fields of HCI and CSCW. However, the impact of integrating gaze and speech as mixed-initiative interactions in LLM-powered reminiscence conversations remains under-explored. To address this, we conducted expert interviews to understand the challenges that older adults face with LLM-powered, photo-based reminiscence experiences. Based on these design considerations, we developed Eye2Recall, a system that integrates eye tracking for detecting visual interest with natural language interaction to create a mixed-initiative reminiscence experience. We evaluated its effectiveness through a user study involving ten older adults. The results have important implications for the future design of more accessible and empowering reminiscence technologies that better align with older adults' natural interaction patterns and enhance their positive aging.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent research at the intersection of LLMs and VR, examining how these models are transforming narrative generation, non-player character (NPC) interactions, accessibility, personalization, and game mastering. Drawing from an analysis of 62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key application domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally generated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay interfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence, including real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks, and scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly enhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their effective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate multimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions in multimodal AI, affective computing, reinforcement learning, and open-source development, aiming to guide the responsible advancement of intelligent and inclusive VR systems.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Balancing Information Accuracy and Response Timeliness in Networked LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02209v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false) queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$ LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-wise Adaptive Integration of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Task-Specific LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13026v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However, this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names, descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic, simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface, highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond prompt-level defenses.</p></details> |  |

Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23 empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM. Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at OZCHI 2025. 23 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.</p></details> |  |

Incentivizing Strategic Cooperation in Multi-LLM Systems via Sequential Public Goods Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02076v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel, game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward, effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACEALIGN -- Tracing the Drift: Attributing Alignment Failures to Training-Time Belief Sources in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02063v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure, little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO, and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB) while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source our implementation at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tracealign-2DA7</p></details> |  |

This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.</p></details> |  |

Cloaking allows attackers to display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A 21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to 33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structure attributes}$ (e.g., response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (e.g., character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavior attributes}$ (e.g., answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggest potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2025.

However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs (e.g., TPUv4) take a middle-ground approach, but the fault explosion radius remains large. We propose InfiniteHBD, a transceiver-centric HBD architecture that integrates connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level by embedding Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) within each transceiver. It enables reconfigurable point-to-multipoint communication and scalable variable-size ring topologies. InfiniteHBD achieves datacenter-scale scalability without cost explosion, fault isolation at the node level, and full bandwidth utilization for healthy GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic-based OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD reduces cost to 31% of NVL-72, achieves a near-zero GPU waste ratio (over 10x lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), maintains near-zero cross-ToR traffic under 7% node fault ratio, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs/node).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer Attention Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02252v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Unifying Both for Goodput-Optimized LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01989v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or disaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has driven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages. This paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels under different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for tight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT), while disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput. This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD disaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of TTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation architecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast prefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode, slow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these instances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by adjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD aggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD disaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode for superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency shifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs to those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests. This fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling mechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill scheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our experiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art systems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 19 figures |

An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating LLM Reasoning via Early Rejection with Partial Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01969v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[KLLM: Fast LLM Inference with K-Means Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23035v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization (WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and arithmetic complexity. Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer quantization for hardware efficiency, but often suffer from significant model performance degradation at low precision. In contrast, K-Means quantization, a non-uniform technique, achieves higher accuracy by aligning with the Gaussian-like distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, two key challenges prevent the efficient deployment of K-Means-based WAQ designs for LLM inference: (1) The non-uniform structure of K-Means-quantized data precludes direct execution on low-precision compute units, necessitating dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during inference. (2) Activation outliers hinder effective low-precision quantization. Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection degrade model performance substantially, while existing online detection techniques introduce significant runtime overhead. To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of K-Means-based WAQ for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose KLLM, an LLM inference accelerator for efficient execution with K-Means-quantized weights and activations. KLLM features an index-based computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a lightweight outlier detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective agent performance relies on the ability to compose tools and agents into effective workflows. However, progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is limited by the scarcity of scalable, reliable evaluation data. This study addresses this limitation by identifying a suitable workflow domain for LLM application. I introduce NL2Flow, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems, which are expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL, and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. NL2Flow generates a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems in automated workflow generation and evaluates multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs without task-specific optimization or architectural modifications. Results reveal that the highest performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible plans. Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. To investigate the potential of LLMs as natural language-to-JSON translators for workflow definition, and to facilitate integration with downstream symbolic computation tools and a symbolic planner, I evaluated the LLM's translation performance on natural language workflow descriptions. I observed that translating natural language into a JSON representation of a workflow problem yielded a lower success rate than generating a plan directly, suggesting that unnecessary decomposition of the reasoning task may degrade performance and highlighting the benefit of models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17075v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences) and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Assisted Model-Based Fuzzing of Protocol Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01750v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort, making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse protocols and implementations. We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations. Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.</p></details> |  |

Real-time inference workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust, automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Generated Heuristics for AI Planning: Do We Even Need Domain-Independence Anymore?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18784v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation. We discuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can complement existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning with Exploration: An Entropy Perspective on Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14758v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing exploration and exploitation is a central goal in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite recent advances in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflecSched: Solving Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling via LLM-Powered Hierarchical Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01724v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic tailored to each instance across all problem cases.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this, we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Innovative tokenisation of structured data for LLM training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01685v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel, hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset (CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient, processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured data.</p></details> |  |

In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needs toward specific downstream predictions, poor generalization, or shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to efficiently learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of four well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which can cover key connections between different dense groups. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different path selections is conducted to justify the rationale behind our designed L2SP method. Next, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts with key phrase selection from node text attributes. We then feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to align next node/edge generation in L2SP with next token generation in causal language modeling for graph representation learning and finally extract the unified graph embeddings. We theoretically analyze the algorithm complexity of our Path-LLM approach. Extensive experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against state-of-the-art methods WalkLM, GraphGPT, OFA, and GraphTranslator on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and edge validation) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search). Compared with WalkLM, our approach saves more than 90% of training paths on millions-scale graphs and runs at most 35x faster.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.</p></details> |  |

A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper presented as an Oral at the ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models</p></details> |

Step-by-step validation is a promising alternative, yet existing methods are often rigid. They struggle to adapt to diverse reasoning structures, from formal proofs to informal natural language narratives. To address this adaptability gap, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV), a novel framework for adaptable and multi-granular verification. GoV's core innovation is its flexible "node block" architecture. This mechanism allows GoV to adaptively adjust its verification granularity--from atomic steps for formal tasks to entire paragraphs for natural language--to match the native structure of the reasoning process. This flexibility allows GoV to resolve the fundamental trade-off between verification precision and robustness. Experiments on both well-structured and loosely-structured benchmarks demonstrate GoV's versatility. The results show that GoV's adaptive approach significantly outperforms both holistic baselines and other state-of-the-art decomposition-based methods, establishing a new standard for training-free reasoning verification.</p></details> |  |

While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique that employs Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, stabilizing fine-tuned LLMs with only O(r) additional parameters, for a given rank r. MonteCLoRA shows 0.5% and 1.6% improvements in accuracy and robustness over unregularized low-rank adaptation method on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust performance with 50% and 62% lower spreads respectively than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted in TMLR'25</p></details> |

However, since models are trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment, where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500 trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment. However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3, N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates (46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions). These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.</p></details> |  |

While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Direct Instruction and Summary-Mediated Prompting in LLM-Assisted Code Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01523v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although "prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification: Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[HuggingGraph: Understanding the Supply Chain of LLM Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14240v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words based on context, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the increasing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying cutting-edge LLMs demand extensive computational resources and large-scale datasets. This creates a significant barrier for researchers and practitioners. Because of that, platforms that host models and datasets have gained widespread popularity. For example, on one of the most popular platforms, i.e., Hugging Face, there are more than 1.8 million models and more than 450K datasets by the end of June 2025, and the trend does not show any slowdown. As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pretrained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks better, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to collect LLMs' supply chain information systematically. With the collected information, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a large directed heterogeneous graph having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Then, on top of this graph, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.</p></details> |  |

To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.

However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present our participation in the 13th edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge, our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.</p></details> |  |

Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows - the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether a LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations. To address this, we present $\it{AIRepr}$, an $\it{A}$nalyst - $\it{I}$nspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the $\it{Repr}$oducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for more transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01443v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated validation and scaling. Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting, and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters, providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASE'25 Industry Showcase</p></details> |
| **[From Query to Logic: Ontology-Driven Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01424v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Bias Associations through Open-Ended LLM Generations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01412v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at https://github.com/JP-25/Discover-Open-Ended-Generation</p></details> |  |
| **[Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online Behavioural Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01390v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaRGen: Multi-Agent LLM Approach for Self-Directed Market Research and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01370v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation. At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer, Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants' presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7 minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to automatically create affordable market insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyClone: Bridging LLM Understanding and Dynamic Execution for Semantic Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01357v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence, particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new metric called Distribution Correction-based Unlearning Evaluation (DCUE). It identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.</p></details> |  |

In response, studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 15 pages |

An NLP-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing (NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner. This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework addressing a critical vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers. This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) an enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability method examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation across multi state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. Our approach significantly enhances factual robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA. Furthermore, our neural activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present a framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The system equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. We propose a more challenging robotic benchmark task and evaluate our framework on the existing benchmark and the novel task. Experimental results show that our metacognitive learning framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework can generate solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches primarily assist users in understanding script logic and spotting potential issues themselves, rather than providing direct validation of correctness. To enhance debugging efficiency and optimize the user experience, we develop ViseGPT, a tool that automatically extracts constraints from user prompts to generate comprehensive test cases for verifying script reliability. The test results are then transformed into a tailored Gantt chart, allowing users to intuitively assess alignment with semantic requirements and iteratively refine their scripts. Our design decisions are informed by a formative study (N=8) that explores user practices and challenges. We further evaluate the effectiveness and usability of ViseGPT through a user study (N=18). Results indicate that ViseGPT significantly improves debugging efficiency for LLM-generated data-wrangling scripts, enhances users' ability to detect and correct issues, and streamlines the workflow experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'25), September 28-October 1, 2025, Busan, Republic of Korea</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.</p></details> |  |

While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability.

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance.

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |

Modeling the evolution of request-making in Human-LLM conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01213v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles, query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable at the community level.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation, we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources, offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1. These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR Theorem for LLM-application design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR (LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech, which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system trained on 179K hours of data.</p></details> |  |

While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, LLMs' judicial fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising 177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBAIO...</summary><p>DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20 real-world scenarios, covering domains like finance, energy, and healthcare.

However, ensuring that these models provide accurate and equitable information tailored to diverse demographic groups remains an important challenge. This study investigates the capability of LLMs to retrieve disaggregated health-related information for sub-ethnic groups within the Asian American population, such as Korean and Chinese communities. Data disaggregation has been a critical practice in health research to address inequities, making it an ideal domain for evaluating representation equity in LLM outputs. We apply a suite of statistical and machine learning tools to assess whether LLMs deliver appropriately disaggregated and equitable information. By focusing on Asian American sub-ethnic groups, a highly diverse population often aggregated in traditional analyses; we highlight how LLMs handle complex disparities in health data. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussions about responsible AI, particularly in ensuring data equity in the outputs of LLM-based systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable software release decisions is critical in safety-critical domains such as automotive manufacturing. Release validation relies on large tabular datasets, yet manual analysis is slow, costly, and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential, they face challenges in analytical reasoning, structured data handling, and ambiguity resolution. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration. This work advances deployable LLM system design by identifying key architectural features-intermediate formal representations, execution efficiency, and low configuration overhead-crucial for safety-critical industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

Of the 25 levels that were technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18 unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow, potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides. Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as practice aids.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |

While LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods. AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server</p></details> |  |

Our key innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity, and aesthetic quality.

| **[Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference: Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01002v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests. In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput. Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the Time To First Token (TTFT) delays. We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics. To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM MM'25</p></details> |

However, the embedding space of traditional spectral embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE) into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction, and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adaptation framework that enables transferring a pre-trained base codec to multiple machine vision tasks through a unified model and a single training process. To achieve this, we design an asymmetric adaptation architecture consisting of a task-agnostic encoder adaptation and task-specific decoder adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce two feature propagation modules to facilitate inter-task and inter-scale feature represenation learning. Experiments on PASCAL-Context and NYUD-V2 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines.

However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools. We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for early personalized risk stratification.

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are publicly available at \href{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MM'25</p></details> |
| **[On the Discriminability of Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13541v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently shown notable success in various visual tasks. However, in terms of discriminability, SSL is still not on par with supervised learning (SL). This paper identifies a key issue, the ``crowding problem," where features from different classes are not well-separated, and there is high intra-class variance. In contrast, SL ensures clear class separation. Our analysis reveals that SSL objectives do not adequately constrain the relationships between samples and their augmentations, leading to poorer performance in complex tasks. We further establish a theoretical framework that connects SSL objectives to cross-entropy risk bounds, explaining how reducing intra-class variance and increasing inter-class separation can improve generalization. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Semantic Adjuster (DSA), a learnable regulator that enhances feature aggregation and separation while being robust to outliers. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets validate that DSA leads to substantial gains in SSL performance, narrowing the performance gap with SL.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADformer: A Multi-Granularity Spatial-Temporal Transformer for EEG-Based Alzheimer Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00032v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient tool to support neurologists in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering or data transformation. While such techniques may provide benefits when working with small-scale datasets, they often lead to information loss and distortion when applied to large-scale data, ultimately limiting model performance. Moreover, the limited subject scale and demographic diversity of datasets used in prior studies hinder comprehensive evaluation of model robustness and generalizability, thus restricting their applicability in real-world clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose ADformer, a novel multi-granularity spatial-temporal transformer designed to capture both temporal and spatial features from raw EEG signals, enabling effective end-to-end representation learning. Our model introduces multi-granularity embedding strategies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging a two-stage intra-inter granularity self-attention mechanism to learn both local patterns within each granularity and global dependencies across granularities. We evaluate ADformer on 4 large-scale datasets comprising a total of 1,713 subjects, representing one of the largest corpora for EEG-based AD detection to date, under a cross-validated, subject-independent setting. Experimental results demonstrate that ADformer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving subject-level F1 scores of 92.82%, 89.83%, 67.99%, and 83.98% on the 4 datasets, respectively, in distinguishing AD from healthy control (HC) subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Taming SAM for Underwater Instance Segmentation and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15581v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure Maintained Representation Learning Neural Network for Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01865v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic health record data from the MIMIC-III database.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEvent: Unified Event Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01842v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in https://github.com/Wickyan/OmniEvent .</p></details> |  |
| **[DRKF: Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01644v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However, inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACM Multimedia 2025. 10 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needs toward specific downstream predictions, poor generalization, or shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to efficiently learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of four well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which can cover key connections between different dense groups. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different path selections is conducted to justify the rationale behind our designed L2SP method. Next, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts with key phrase selection from node text attributes. We then feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to align next node/edge generation in L2SP with next token generation in causal language modeling for graph representation learning and finally extract the unified graph embeddings. We theoretically analyze the algorithm complexity of our Path-LLM approach. Extensive experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against state-of-the-art methods WalkLM, GraphGPT, OFA, and GraphTranslator on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and edge validation) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search). Compared with WalkLM, our approach saves more than 90% of training paths on millions-scale graphs and runs at most 35x faster.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19903v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, PS3 and VILA-HD outperform previous vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP2 and Perception Encoder) and MLLMs (e.g., NVILA and Qwen2.5-VL) respectively across multiple benchmarks and achieve better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 16.1% improvement over GPT-4o and a 7.5% improvement and 1.67x speedup over Qwen2.5-VL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

While existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection (MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability. Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even against unseen generators like Sora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

However, AVER remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external knowledge injection. In Stage~1, a unified and lightweight representation network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In Stage~2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design, highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/VAEmo</p></details> |

Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

| **[VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01292v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS, BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model, is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.</p></details> | Preprint |

Most existing methods mainly rely on the networked unconfoundedness assumption, which guarantees the identification of networked effects. However, this assumption is often violated due to the latent confounders inherent in observational data, thereby hindering the identification of networked effects. To address this issue, we leverage the rich interaction patterns between units in networks, which provide valuable information for recovering these latent confounders. Building on this insight, we develop a confounder recovery framework that explicitly characterizes three categories of latent confounders in networked settings: those affecting only the unit, those affecting only the unit's neighbors, and those influencing both. Based on this framework, we design a networked effect estimator using identifiable representation learning techniques. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove the identifiability of all three types of latent confounders and, by leveraging the recovered confounders, establish a formal identification result for networked effects. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.03342</p></details> |

The quality of representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space. However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local) uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global) uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions. This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby improving global uniformity while preserving local representation expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as an effective solution to this challenge.

To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to restore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and across modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing complementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge from perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes, guiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations. Extensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01139v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into SMILES, enriching SMILES with detailed chemical context. For example, instead of using "O" to represent all oxygen atoms, we use specific tokens like "O_ketone" and "O_hydroxyl" to differentiate oxygen atoms belonging to distinct functional groups. This tokenization expands the chemical lexicon, effectively bridging the gap between SMILES and natural language in terms of vocabulary size, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by (1) using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and (2) employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. FARM leverages contrastive learning to aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 out of 13 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning and demonstrate its strong transfer learning capabilities, paving the way for promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, existing mobile models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT) tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis.

We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho = -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Cross-Training Learners for Robust Generalization under Data Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20046v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning benefits from cross-training strategies, which enables models to train on data from distinct sources to improve generalization capability. However, due to inherent differences in data distributions, the optimization goals of local models remain misaligned, and this mismatch continues to manifest as feature space heterogeneity even after cross-training. We argue that knowledge distillation from the personalized view preserves client-specific characteristics and expands the local knowledge base, while distillation from the global view provides consistent semantic anchors that facilitate feature alignment across clients. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a cross-training scheme, termed FedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which enhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient federated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and local views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after model exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global knowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich information to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables the model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT alleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables it outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across Histopathology and Molecular Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00969v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS, a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities, seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

While existing methods have demonstrated the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI2026</p></details> |

Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning Unified User Quantized Tokenizers for User Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00956v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generator to Embedder: Harnessing Innate Abilities of Multimodal LLMs via Building Zero-Shot Discriminative Embedding Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00955v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8 points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly reducing training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Branch Specialization in Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks for Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine spectral-spatial architectures for enhanced representation learning. However, limited attention has been paid to certified robustness, particularly regarding training strategies and underlying rationale. In this paper, we explicitly specialize each branch: the spectral network is trained to withstand l0 edge flips and capture homophilic structures, while the spatial part is designed to resist linf feature perturbations and heterophilic patterns. A context-aware gating network adaptively fuses the two representations, dynamically routing each node's prediction to the more reliable branch. This specialized adversarial training scheme uses branch-specific inner maximization (structure vs feature attacks) and a unified alignment objective. We provide theoretical guarantees: (i) expressivity of the gating mechanism beyond 1-WL, (ii) spectral-spatial frequency bias, and (iii) certified robustness with trade-off. Empirically, SpecSphere attains state-of-the-art node classification accuracy and offers tighter certified robustness on real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, such pairs often contain noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite their scalability advantages, existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation. Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the recursive neighborhood aggregations employed by GCNs, efficient training methods suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees or are missing important practical elements from modern deep learning algorithms, such as adaptivity and momentum. In this paper, we present several neighbor-sampling (NS) based Adam-type stochastic methods for solving a nonconvex GCN training problem. We utilize the control variate technique proposed by [1] to reduce the stochastic error caused by neighbor sampling. Under standard assumptions for Adam-type methods, we show that our methods enjoy the optimal convergence rate. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on node classification tasks with several benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate superior performance of our methods over classic NS-based SGD that also uses the control-variate technique, especially for large-scale graph datasets.

Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and 39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces directional sign loss (DSL), an efficient, differentiable loss function that approximates the number of mismatches in the signs of finite differences between corresponding elements of two arrays. By penalizing discrepancies in critical points between input and reconstructed data, DSL encourages autoencoders and other learnable compressors to retain the topological features of the original data. We present the formulation and complexity analysis of DSL, comparing it to other non-differentiable topological measures. Experiments on multidimensional array data show that combining DSL with traditional loss functions preserves topological features more effectively than traditional losses alone. DSL serves as a differentiable, efficient proxy for common topology-based metrics, enabling topological feature preservation on previously impractical problem sizes and in a wider range of gradient-based optimization frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Conceptual pairs in the two modalities such as rhythm and rhyme, note duration and syllabic stress, and structure correspondence, raise a compelling yet seldom-explored direction in the field of music information retrieval. In this paper, we present melody-lyrics matching (MLM), a new task which retrieves potential lyrics for a given symbolic melody from text sources. Rather than generating lyrics from scratch, MLM essentially exploits the relationships between melody and lyrics. We propose a self-supervised representation learning framework with contrastive alignment loss for melody and lyrics. This has the potential to leverage the abundance of existing songs with paired melody and lyrics. No alignment annotations are required. Additionally, we introduce sylphone, a novel representation for lyrics at syllable-level activated by phoneme identity and vowel stress. We demonstrate that our method can match melody with coherent and singable lyrics with empirical results and intuitive examples. We open source code and provide matching examples on the companion webpage: https://github.com/changhongw/mlm.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial potential in embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Robustness and Functional Localization in Topographic CNNs Through Weight Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00043v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end, here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii) greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii) stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units, indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training, WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, the mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times, which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a promising direction in representation learning. However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-SCMM: Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling for Cross-Corpus EEG-Based Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09186v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods often lack generalization in cross-corpus settings, where a model trained on one dataset is directly applied to another without retraining, due to differences in data distribution and recording conditions. To tackle the challenge of cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition, we propose a novel framework termed Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM). Grounded in the theory of emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a hybrid masking strategy to effectively capture emotion dynamics (refer to short-term continuity). Specifically, in the self-supervised learning stage, we propose a soft weighting mechanism that assigns similarity scores to sample pairs, enabling fine-grained modeling of emotional transitions and capturing the temporal continuity of human emotions. To further enhance representation learning, we design a similarity-aware aggregator that fuses complementary information from semantically related samples based on pairwise similarities, thereby improving feature expressiveness and reconstruction quality. This dual design contributes to a more discriminative and transferable representation, which is crucial for robust cross-corpus generalization. Extensive experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP datasets show that SCMM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming the second-best method by an average accuracy of 4.26% under both same-class and different-class cross-corpus settings.

| **[Your Spending Needs Attention: Modeling Financial Habits with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23267v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive models play a crucial role in the financial industry, enabling risk prediction, fraud detection, and personalized recommendations, where slight changes in core model performance can result in billions of dollars in revenue or losses. While financial institutions have access to enormous amounts of user data (e.g., bank transactions, in-app events, and customer support logs), leveraging this data effectively remains challenging due to its complexity and scale. Thus, in many financial institutions, most production models follow traditional machine learning (ML) approaches by converting unstructured data into manually engineered tabular features. Conversely, other domains (e.g., natural language processing) have effectively utilized self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn rich representations from raw data, removing the need for manual feature extraction. In this paper, we investigate using transformer-based representation learning models for transaction data, hypothesizing that these models, trained on massive data, can provide a novel and powerful approach to understanding customer behavior. We propose a new method enabling the use of SSL with transaction data by adapting transformer-based models to handle both textual and structured attributes. Our approach, denoted nuFormer, includes an end-to-end fine-tuning method that integrates user embeddings with existing tabular features. Our experiments demonstrate improvements for large-scale recommendation problems at Nubank. Notably, these gains are achieved solely through enhanced representation learning rather than incorporating new data sources.</p></details> |  |

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

The spectra of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We approach this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

However, most existing research still struggles to address the challenges posed by environments where multiple vehicles have to interact seamlessly. This study aims to integrate causal learning with reinforcement learning-based methods by leveraging causal disentanglement representation learning (CDRL) to identify and extract causal features that influence optimal decision-making in autonomous vehicles. These features are then incorporated into graph neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance decision-making in complex traffic scenarios. By using causal features as inputs, the proposed approach enables the optimization of vehicle behavior at an unsignalized intersection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest average reward during training and our approach significantly outperforms other learning-based methods in several key metrics such as collision rate and average cumulative reward during testing. This study provides a promising direction for advancing multi-agent autonomous driving systems and make autonomous vehicles' navigation safer and more efficient in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

While some techniques focus on preserving comprehensive details through reconstruction, others favor semantic structure via contrastive objectives. Few works examine the interaction between these paradigms in a unified SSL framework. In this work, we propose a multi-view SSL framework for disentangling music audio representations that combines contrastive and reconstructive objectives. The architecture is designed to promote both information fidelity and structured semantics of factors in disentangled subspaces. We perform an extensive evaluation on the design choices of contrastive strategies using music audio representations in a controlled setting. We find that while reconstruction and contrastive strategies exhibit consistent trade-offs, when combined effectively, they complement each other; this enables the disentanglement of music attributes without compromising information integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of WASPAA 2025. 4 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce \underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o \underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection. 3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%, and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA, respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.

Hyperbolic geometry, with its constant negative curvature and exponential growth property, naturally accommodates such structures, offering a promising alternative for learning rich graph representations. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving field of Hyperbolic Graph Learning (HGL). We systematically categorize and analyze existing methods broadly dividing them into (1) hyperbolic graph embedding-based techniques, (2) graph neural network-based hyperbolic models, and (3) emerging paradigms. Beyond methodologies, we extensively discuss diverse applications of HGL across multiple domains, including recommender systems, knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, and other relevant scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in real-world graph learning tasks. Most importantly, we identify several key challenges that serve as directions for advancing HGL, including handling complex data structures, developing geometry-aware learning objectives, ensuring trustworthy and scalable implementations, and integrating with foundation models, e.g., large language models. We highlight promising research opportunities in this exciting interdisciplinary area.

However, these methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits. First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, website: https://chuxwa.github.io/project_StruMamba3D/</p></details> |

However, deciphering reaction mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core, Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes 3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a 3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10 datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions. This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22216v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

To this end, we formulate a novel application of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings. Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome representation learning.

To address this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex feature engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments:12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; accepted to the 26th World Conference on Information Security Applications (WISA 2025)</p></details> |

The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA).

Recent CLIP-like methods based on contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method (BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image representations, including both global category representation and the patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.</p></details> | V1 |

Existing methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or privacy risks, or fail to jointly address data heterogeneity and structured missingness. We propose the \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{P}robability \textbf{M}ass \textbf{K}ernel (\textbf{HI-PMK}), a novel data-dependent representation learning approach that eliminates the need for imputation. HI-PMK introduces two key innovations: (1) a probability mass-based dissimilarity measure that adapts to local data distributions across heterogeneous features (numerical, ordinal, nominal), and (2) a missingness-aware uncertainty strategy (MaxU) that conservatively handles all three missingness mechanisms by assigning maximal plausible dissimilarity to unobserved entries. Our approach is privacy-preserving, scalable, and readily applicable to downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Extensive experiments on over 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HI-PMK consistently outperforms traditional imputation-based pipelines and kernel methods across a wide range of missing data settings.

However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability, as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible, expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and 2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module. This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich captions.

Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Global Communications Conference (GlobeCom) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Learning with Subsequence Reordering Pretraining for Compound-Protein Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20925v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1) Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2) Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences. Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Hoch-Zhang/PSRP-CPI.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in self-supervised representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1) determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

However, existing methods typically rely on conventional network structures and fail to capture the polyadic interactions intrinsic to many real-world systems. To address this limitation, we study key node identification in hypergraphs, where higher-order interactions are naturally modeled as hyperedges. We propose a novel framework, AHGA, which integrates an Autoencoder for extracting higher-order structural features, a HyperGraph neural network-based pre-training module (HGNN), and an Active learning-based fine-tuning process. This fine-tuning step plays a vital role in mitigating the gap between synthetic and real-world data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization across diverse hypergraph topologies. Extensive experiments on eight empirical hypergraphs show that AHGA outperforms classical centrality-based baselines by approximately 37.4%. Furthermore, the nodes identified by AHGA exhibit both high influence and strong structural disruption capability, demonstrating their superiority in detecting multifunctional nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complementarity-driven Representation Learning for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20620v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Distributed Optical Fiber Vibration Recognition via Extreme Lightweight Model and Cross-Domain Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20587v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) systems offer a promising solution for large-scale monitoring and intrusion event recognition. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges: degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

While recent advances in pretrained protein and antibody language models (PPLMs and PALMs) have greatly enhanced biomolecular understanding, nanobody-specific modeling remains underexplored and lacks a unified benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce NbBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning. Spanning eight biologically meaningful tasks across nine curated datasets, NbBench encompasses structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability assessment. We systematically evaluate eleven representative models -- including general-purpose protein LMs, antibody-specific LMs, and nanobody-specific LMs -- in a frozen setting. Our analysis reveals that antibody language models excel in antigen-related tasks, while performance on regression tasks such as thermostability and affinity remains challenging across all models. Notably, no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. By standardizing datasets, task definitions, and evaluation protocols, NbBench offers a reproducible foundation for assessing and advancing nanobody modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation for Exemplar-Free Lifelong Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15041v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong Person Re-identification (LReID) suffers from a key challenge in preserving old knowledge while adapting to new information. The existing solutions include rehearsal-based and rehearsal-free methods to address this challenge. Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation, continuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process. Rehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain, leading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores cross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution integration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a Text-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich prompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained representations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of identity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution awareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed to capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and adaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In this manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation learning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a Knowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level discrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate model adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote knowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific distributions, respectively. Experimental results show that our DAFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/LiuShiBen/DAFC.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Revised Version 4 |

However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales. Additionally, a novel two-stage self-training strategy is proposed to align 2D and 3D representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across various downstream tasks, including 3D classification, part segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

The localized feature aggregation in a typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies. However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initially submitted this draft at Tiny ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as K.

As a starting point, we use our framework to reproduce the symmetry-based representations from the symmetry-based disentangled representation learning (SBDRL) formalism proposed by [1]; only the algebra of transformations of worlds that form groups can be described using symmetry-based representations. We then study the algebras of the transformations of worlds with features that occur in simple reinforcement learning scenarios. Using computational methods, that we developed, we extract the algebras of the transformations of these worlds and classify them according to their properties. Finally, we generalise two important results of SBDRL - the equivariance condition and the disentangling definition - from only working with symmetry-based representations to working with representations capturing the transformation properties of worlds with transformations for any algebra. Finally, we combine our generalised equivariance condition and our generalised disentangling definition to show that disentangled sub-algebras can each have their own individual equivariance conditions, which can be treated independently.</p></details> |  |

Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.</p></details> |  |

As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data. Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios.

In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning.

While dominant in neural networks, representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders. These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by fine-tuning deep networks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos; however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards. Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual robotic skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025, oral presentation.

In this work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19, significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.</p></details> |  |

In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at: https://github.com/peng-lab/hescape</p></details> |

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |

The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGE: Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement via Bridging Visual and Semantic Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21741v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[One-stage Modality Distillation for Incomplete Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08204v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Everything is a Video: Unifying Modalities through Next-Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10503v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which involves integrating information from various modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, is pivotal for numerous complex tasks like visual question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and caption generation. Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TransPrune: Token Transition Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20630v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL.

While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable, multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.</p></details> |  |

TD-Interpreter is a visual question-answer environment which allows engineers to input a set of TDs and ask design and verification queries regarding these TDs. We implemented TD-Interpreter with multimodal learning by fine-tuning LLaVA, a lightweight 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). To address limited training data availability, we developed a synthetic data generation workflow that aligns visual information with its textual interpretation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of TD-Interpreter which outperformed untuned GPT-4o by a large margin on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified the abstract and reformatted it using latex</p></details> |

While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).

However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

However, most current methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks: canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping. The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low-data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong performances near or better than the state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

Haptic-Informed ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-Informed ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for biomedical automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS2025) Project website https://tanichu-laboratory.github.io/pedro_haptic_act_iros2025/</p></details> |
| **[Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.</p></details> | acm multimedia 2025 |
| **[A Robust Incomplete Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation Approach for Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11202v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Sentiment Analysis on CMU-MOSEI Dataset using Transformer-based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06110v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text, audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10213v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning Framework For Intake Gesture Detection Using Contactless Radar and Wearable IMU Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07261v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and is currently under review</p></details> |

While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAIP 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.08716</p></details> |
| **[Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05636v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 178 pages |

Where Do We Stand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10966v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of brain infarction (i.e., irreversibly damaged tissue) is critical for guiding treatment decisions in acute ischemic stroke. Reliable infarct prediction informs key clinical interventions, including the need for patient transfer to comprehensive stroke centers, the potential benefit of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, decisions regarding secondary neuroprotective treatments, and ultimately, prognosis of clinical outcomes. This work introduces the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2024 challenge, which focuses on the prediction of final infarct volumes from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES24 provides a comprehensive, multimodal setting where participants can leverage all clinically and practically available data, including full acute CT imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and structured clinical information, across a train set of 150 cases. On the hidden test set of 98 cases, the top-performing model, a multimodal nnU-Net-based architecture, achieved a Dice score of 0.285 (+/- 0.213) and an absolute volume difference of 21.2 (+/- 37.2) mL, underlining the significant challenges posed by this task and the need for further advances in multimodal learning. This work makes two primary contributions: first, we establish a standardized, clinically realistic benchmark for post-treatment infarct prediction, enabling systematic evaluation of multimodal algorithmic strategies on a longitudinal stroke dataset; second, we analyze current methodological limitations and outline key research directions to guide the development of next-generation infarct prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODA: MOdular Duplex Attention for Multimodal Perception, Cognition, and Emotion Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04635v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.

These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

| **[Intelligent Histology for Tumor Neurosurgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03037v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology, that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology (SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes. Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Robustness to Missing Modalities through Clustered Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06911v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Gated Recursive Fusion: A Stateful Approach to Scalable Multimodal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02985v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Test-Time Consistency in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22395v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency. Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sheaf-Based Decentralized Multimodal Learning for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22374v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[VGAT: A Cancer Survival Analysis Framework Transitioning from Generative Visual Question Answering to Genomic Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19367v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning combining pathology images and genomic sequences enhances cancer survival analysis but faces clinical implementation barriers due to limited access to genomic sequencing in under-resourced regions. To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[ImplicitQA: Going beyond frames towards Implicit Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21742v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions, objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips. In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities. Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for molecular property prediction.</p></details> |  |

| **[LLaVA-CMoE: Towards Continual Mixture of Experts for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21227v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have recently advanced the scalability and adaptability of large language models (LLMs) for continual multimodal learning. However, efficiently extending these models to accommodate sequential tasks remains challenging. As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to rapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes catastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs that requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter efficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to dynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling adaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity. Furthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a dedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels are unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy to identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing automatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing conflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning without explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark, covering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong continual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly reducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods. These results showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models. Our code will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

Although the methods are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g., motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g., smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use. Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EC-TEL25: 20th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, Newcastle and Durham, UK, 15-19 September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Emergence of Text Readability in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19389v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EVAL-...</summary><p>EVAL-FoMo Workshop @ CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This work systematically investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent ``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm, providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in traditionally unimodal scenarios.</p></details> | 4 figures,7 tables |
| **[With Limited Data for Multimodal Alignment, Let the STRUCTURE Guide You](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16895v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICC: Quantifying Image Caption Concreteness for Multimodal Dataset Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01306v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web-scale training on paired text-image data is becoming increasingly central to multimodal learning, but is challenged by the highly noisy nature of datasets in the wild. Standard data filtering approaches succeed in removing mismatched text-image pairs, but permit semantically related but highly abstract or subjective text. These approaches lack the fine-grained ability to isolate the most concrete samples that provide the strongest signal for learning in a noisy dataset. In this work, we propose a new metric, image caption concreteness, that evaluates caption text without an image reference to measure its concreteness and relevancy for use in multimodal learning. Our approach leverages strong foundation models for measuring visual-semantic information loss in multimodal representations. We demonstrate that this strongly correlates with human evaluation of concreteness in both single-word and sentence-level texts. Moreover, we show that curation using ICC complements existing approaches: It succeeds in selecting the highest quality samples from multimodal web-scale datasets to allow for efficient training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 (Finding).

Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures.

| **[A Strong View-Free Baseline Approach for Single-View Image Guided Point Cloud Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15747v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers, effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC.

This study compares multimodal and CNN-based methods for automated classification using the BI-RADS system, evaluating BioMedCLIP and ConvNeXt across three learning scenarios: zero-shot classification, linear probing with textual descriptions, and fine-tuning with numerical labels. Results show that zero-shot classification achieved modest performance, while the fine-tuned ConvNeXt model outperformed the BioMedCLIP linear probe. Although linear probing demonstrated potential with pretrained embeddings, it was less effective than full fine-tuning. These findings suggest that despite the promise of multimodal learning, CNN-based models with end-to-end fine-tuning provide stronger performance for specialized medical imaging. The study underscores the need for more detailed textual representations and domain-specific adaptations in future radiology applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data (e.g., heart rate, eye movement) and dynamically adjust interface elements to mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast. Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22% improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and usability in wearable computing environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11550v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories, including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately 6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

| **[Learning to Fuse: Modality-Aware Adaptive Scheduling for Robust Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12733v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, existing approaches often adopt fixed or task-specific fusion strategies, neglecting the intrinsic variability of modality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing, or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP. Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have focused on enhancing the robustness of pre-trained MultiModal Transformers (MMTs) under missing modality conditions by applying learnable prompts. However, these prompt-based methods face several limitations: (1) incomplete modalities provide restricted modal cues for task-specific inference, (2) dummy imputation for missing content causes information loss and introduces noise, and (3) static prompts are instance-agnostic, offering limited knowledge for instances with various missing conditions. To address these issues, we propose RAGPT, a novel Retrieval-AuGmented dynamic Prompt Tuning framework. RAGPT comprises three modules: (I) the multi-channel retriever, which identifies similar instances through a within-modality retrieval strategy, (II) the missing modality generator, which recovers missing information using retrieved contexts, and (III) the context-aware prompter, which captures contextual knowledge from relevant instances and generates dynamic prompts to largely enhance the MMT's robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that RAGPT consistently outperforms all competitive baselines in handling incomplete modality problems.

| **[Understanding the Emergence of Multimodal Representation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16282v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models.

| **[RollingQ: Reviving the Cooperation Dynamics in Multimodal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11465v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples. Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality, widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability, we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers.

However, its open-ended nature makes tracking project development and assessing success challenging. We investigate how dialogue and system interaction logs predict project quality during collaborative, project-based AI learning of 94 middle school students working in pairs. We used linguistic features from dialogue transcripts and behavioral features from system logs to predict three project quality outcomes: productivity (number of training phrases), content richness (word density), and lexical variation (word diversity) of chatbot training phrases. We compared the predictive accuracy of each modality and a fusion of the modalities. Results indicate log data better predicts productivity, while dialogue data is more effective for content richness. Both modalities modestly predict lexical variation. Multimodal fusion improved predictions for productivity and lexical variation of training phrases but not content richness. These findings suggest that the value of multimodal fusion depends on the specific learning outcome. The study contributes to multimodal learning analytics by demonstrating the nuanced interplay between behavioral and linguistic data in assessing student learning progress in open-ended AI learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research paper accepted to the 9th Educational Data Mining in Computer Science Education (CSEDM) Workshop</p></details> |

Challenges include disagreement in labeling among annotators and imbalanced data distributions. This paper presents a reproducible framework that achieves superior (top 1) performance in the Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge (IS25-SER Challenge) - Task 2, evaluated on the MSP-Podcast dataset. Our system is designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges through multimodal learning, multi-task learning, and imbalanced data handling. Specifically, our best system is trained by adding text embeddings, predicting gender, and including ``Other'' (O) and ``No Agreement'' (X) samples in the training set. Our system's results secured both first and second places in the IS25-SER Challenge, and the top performance was achieved by a simple two-system ensemble.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data is open source.

This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral presentation skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in LASI Spain 25: Learning Analytics Summer Institute Spain 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination at a Glance: Controlled Visual Edits and Fine-Grained Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07227v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory data under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture, Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot. Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission success rate across diverse indoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Astra...</summary><p>Astra Technical Report</p></details> |

However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions, including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage community-driven solutions.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

However, generating emotionally expressive and abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g., Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line, light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally aligned images from text. Our work provides essential data and benchmarks for emotion-driven image synthesis and aims to advance fields such as affective computing, multimodal learning, and computational art, enabling applications in art therapy and creative design.

Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene understanding.

Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The datasets are accessible through the GitHub page: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit-retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning.

In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections. However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts. Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM, with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across various tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards disentangling the contributions of articulation and acoustics in multimodal phoneme recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24059v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models' attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for certain phonemes.</p></details> |  |

To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The dataset, source code, and trained models were released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional predictive coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Modeling and Optimization of Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23040v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification. However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore, despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer, 2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data. The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG) test metrics (AVG = 87.03\%) in HAM10000 dataset with multimodal learning, while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\% compared to swin\_b with 81.33\% in FL model. Furthermore, the use of support vector machine (SVM) can improve the overall test metrics with AVG of $\sim 2\%$ for swin transformer series in ISIC2018.
