| **[LHGEL: Large Heterogeneous Graph Ensemble Learning using Batch View Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03432v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from large heterogeneous graphs presents significant challenges due to the scale of networks, heterogeneity in node and edge types, variations in nodal features, and complex local neighborhood structures. This paper advocates for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation, residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning. Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Transmission Grid Topology Control: Busbar Information Asymmetry and Heterogeneous Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factors such as the proliferation of renewable energy and electrification contribute to grid congestion as a pressing problem. Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures.

| **[VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |
| **[IoDResearch: Deep Research on Private Heterogeneous Data via the Internet of Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01553v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management. Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation. Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | 8 pages,4 figures |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Diverse Behavioral Traffic: A Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25751v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Long-Range Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23660v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |
| **[Think-on-Graph 3.0: Efficient and Adaptive LLM Reasoning on Heterogeneous Graphs via Multi-Agent Dual-Evolving Context Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21710v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures, they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unmasking Fake Careers: Detecting Machine-Generated Career Trajectories via Multi-layer Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19677v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly realistic synthetic data. We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[MH-GIN: Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based Imputation Network for AIS Data (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20362v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available https://github.com/hyLiu1994/MH-GIN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures; This paper is accepted by PVLDB 2026</p></details> |
| **[Clinical Multi-modal Fusion with Heterogeneous Graph and Disease Correlation Learning for Multi-Disease Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15852v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-disease diagnosis using multi-modal data like electronic health records and medical imaging is a critical clinical task. Although existing deep learning methods have achieved initial success in this area, a significant gap persists for their real-world application. This gap arises because they often overlook unavoidable practical challenges, such as modality missingness, noise, temporal asynchrony, and evidentiary inconsistency across modalities for different diseases. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGDC-Fuse, a novel framework that constructs a patient-centric multi-modal heterogeneous graph to robustly integrate asynchronous and incomplete multi-modal data. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous graph learning module to aggregate multi-source information, featuring a disease correlation-guided attention layer that resolves the modal inconsistency issue by learning disease-specific modality weights based on disease correlations. On the large-scale MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets, HGDC-Fuse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Optimize Capacity Planning in Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15767v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines, trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions. Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Acoustic event Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14893v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal acoustic event classification plays a key role in audio-visual systems. Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top K Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Attacks on Heterogeneous Graph Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01964v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Large Language Models for Data Challenges in Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18475v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction. While graph learning has achieved remarkable progress, real-world graph data presents a number of challenges that significantly hinder the learning process. In this survey, we focus on four fundamental data-centric challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey focuses on how LLMs can address four fundamental data-centric challenges in graph-structured data, thereby improving the effectiveness of graph learning. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field. To support further exploration, we have curated a repository of recent advances on graph learning challenges: https://github.com/limengran98/Awesome-Literature-Graph-Learning-Challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |
| **[Deep Temporal Graph Networks for Real-Time Correction of GNSS Jamming-Induced Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14000v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction. We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |
| **[BIGNet: Pretrained Graph Neural Network for Embedding Semantic, Spatial, and Topological Data in BIM Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11104v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data, overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM (Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |

Traditional detection methods often struggle to capture the intricate relational structures inherent in transactional data. This study presents a novel fraud detection framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively identify fraudulent activities in e-commerce online payment transactions. A dataset of 2,840,000 transactions was collected over 14 days from major platforms such as Amazon, involving approximately 2,000 U.S.-based consumers and 30 merchants. With fewer than 6000 fraudulent instances, the dataset represents a highly imbalanced scenario. Consumers and merchants were modeled as nodes and transactions as edges to form a heterogeneous graph, upon which a GCN was applied to learn complex behavioral patterns. Semantic features extracted via GPT-4o and Tabformer were integrated with structural features to enhance detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.98, effectively balancing precision and sensitivity in fraud detection. This framework offers a scalable and real-time solution for securing online payment environments and provides a promising direction for applying graph-based deep learning in financial fraud prevention.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is in proceedings of the 34th IJCAI Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have extended prediction techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</p></details> |  |

When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models (FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |
| **[HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02481v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management, as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g., rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences, thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97), improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer, demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines.

| **[Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning for Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words, stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection, which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted to CIKM'25 |

Inferring global socioeconomic indicators from a limited number of regional samples is essential for enhancing management and sustainability in urban areas and human settlements. Current inference methods typically rely on spatial interpolation based on the assumption of spatial continuity, which does not adequately address the complex variations present within regional spaces. In this paper, we present GeoHG, the first space-aware socioeconomic indicator inference method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph-based structure to represent geospace for non-continuous inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in comparison to existing methods, achieving an $R^2$ score exceeding 0.8 under extreme data scarcity with a masked ratio of 95\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM S...</summary><p>ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025 Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[GOSU: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Global-Level Optimized Semantic Unit-Centric Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00449v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield, a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

The model is trained and evaluated using major benchmark datasets: Sanger GDSC, NCI60, and Broad CTRP, which cover a wide range of drugs and cancer cell lines. drGT demonstrates AUROC of up to 94.5% under random splitting, 84.4% for unseen drugs, and 70.6% for unseen cell lines, comparable to existing benchmark methods while also providing interpretability. Regarding interpretability, we review drug-gene co-occurrences by text-mining PubMed abstracts for high-coefficient genes mentioning particular drugs. Across 976 drugs from NCI60 with known drug-target interactions (DTIs), model predictions utilized both known DTIs (36.9%) as well as additional predictive associations, many supported by literature. In addition, we compare the drug-gene associations identified by drGT with those from an established DTI prediction model and find that 63.67% are supported by either PubMed literature or predictions from the DTI model. Further, we describe the utilization of ACs to identify affected biological processes by each drug via enrichment analyses, thereby enhancing biological interpretability.

However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multimodal heterogeneous graph.

Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning models. In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small, medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.</p></details> |  |

This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types.

Experimental results indicate that AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction (SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of 33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the best-performing models.</p></details> |  |

While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Attributes and Multi-Scale Structures for Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13911v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Multi-View Graph Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12377v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view graph data, which both captures node attributes and rich relational information from diverse sources, is becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains. The effective and efficient retrieval of such data is an important task. Although multi-view hashing techniques have offered a paradigm for fusing diverse information into compact binary codes, they typically assume attributes-based inputs per view. This makes them unsuitable for multi-view graph data, where effectively encoding and fusing complex topological information from multiple heterogeneous graph views to generate unified binary embeddings remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Contrastive Multi-view Graph Hashing (CMGHash), a novel end-to-end framework designed to learn unified and discriminative binary embeddings from multi-view graph data. CMGHash learns a consensus node representation space using a contrastive multi-view graph loss, which aims to pull $k$-nearest neighbors from all graphs closer while pushing away negative pairs, i.e., non-neighbor nodes. Moreover, we impose binarization constraints on this consensus space, enabling its conversion to a corresponding binary embedding space at minimal cost. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMGHash significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Detecting misinformation in short videos is challenging due to their multi-modal nature and the limited context of individual videos. While recent methods focus on analyzing content signals-visual, textual, and audio-they often overlook implicit relationships among videos, uploaders, and events. To address this gap, we propose DugFND (Dual-community graph for fake news detection), a novel method that enhances existing video classifiers by modeling two key community patterns: (1) uploader communities, where uploaders with shared interests or similar content creation patterns group together, and (2) event-driven communities, where videos related to the same or semantically similar public events form localized clusters. We construct a heterogeneous graph connecting uploader, video, and event nodes, and design a time-aware heterogeneous graph attention network to enable effective message passing. A reconstruction-based pretraining phase further improves node representation learning. DugFND can be applied to any pre-trained classifier. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves significant performance gains, demonstrating the value of dual-community modeling for fake news detection in short videos.</p></details> | in submission |

However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics.

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks: Bridging Heterophily and Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06034v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted tp CIKM 2025</p></details> |

In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for more expressive and semantically rich encodings. In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values. Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In practical scenarios involving heterogeneous distributed graph data, personalized Federated Graph Learning (pFGL) aims to enhance model utility by training personalized models tailored to client needs. However, existing pFGL methods often require numerous communication rounds under heterogeneous graphs, leading to significant communication overhead and security concerns. While One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) enables collaboration in a single round, existing OFL methods are designed for image-centric tasks and are ineffective for graph data, leaving a critical gap in the field. Additionally, personalized models derived from existing methods suffer from bias, failing to effectively generalize to the minority. To address these challenges, we propose the first \textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{p}ersonalized \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{G}raph \textbf{L}earning method (\textbf{O-pFGL}) for node classification, compatible with Secure Aggregation protocols for privacy preservation. Specifically, for effective graph learning in one communication round, our method estimates and aggregates class-wise feature distribution statistics to construct a global surrogate graph on the server, facilitating the training of a global graph model. To mitigate bias, we introduce a two-stage personalized training approach that adaptively balances local personal information and global insights from the surrogate graph, improving both personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments on 14 diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automatic database O&M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBAIO...</summary><p>DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20 real-world scenarios, covering domains like finance, energy, and healthcare.

However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model, GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness.

It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Hypergraph Networks for Multimodal Sequence Data Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00926v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution to extract high-order dependencies.

| **[Masked Language Models are Good Heterogeneous Graph Generalizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06157v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

While successful in text and image domains, synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity. In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation. To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains: system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |

However, most existing models focus only on direct similarity in homogeneous graphs, failing to exploit the rich similarity in heterogeneous graphs. To address this gap, inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module, learning global similarity through an affinity-enhanced drug-target graph, and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module, capturing higher-order similarity by amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors using an even-polynomial graph filter based on balance theory. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively capture similarity information across multiple interaction scales within affinity and association matrices. To address the issue of imbalance in DTI datasets, we propose an adjustable imbalance loss function that adjusts the weight of negative samples by the parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SOC-DGL consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Moreover, SOC-DGL successfully predicts the top 9 drugs known to bind ABL1, and further analyzed the 10th drug, which has not been experimentally confirmed to interact with ABL1, providing supporting evidence for its potential binding.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures (including subfigures), 5 tables.

PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites (LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI), energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV (IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework. It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIF-MR: Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09998v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) and multimodal item information, which respectively capture relational and attribute features, play a crucial role in improving recommender system accuracy. Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |

However, the neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by structure dependency in HGNNs makes it challenging to deploy for latency-constrained applications that require fast inference. Inspired by recent GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation frameworks, we introduce HG2M and HG2M+ to combine both HGNN's superior performance and MLP's efficient inference. HG2M directly trains student MLPs with node features as input and soft labels from teacher HGNNs as targets, and HG2M+ further distills reliable and heterogeneous semantic knowledge into student MLPs through reliable node distillation and reliable meta-path distillation. Experiments conducted on six heterogeneous graph datasets show that despite lacking structural dependencies, HG2Ms can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and significantly outperform vanilla MLPs. Moreover, HG2Ms demonstrate a 379.24$\times$ speedup in inference over HGNNs on the large-scale IGB-3M-19 dataset, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

We demonstrate that only a subset of access points (APs) has to be activated for both tasks, while deactivating redundant APs is essential for power savings. This motivates joint active AP selection and power control for optimizing energy efficiency. The resultant problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To address this, we propose a model-based Branch-and-Bound approach as a strong baseline to guide a semi-supervised heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) for selecting the best active APs and the power allocation. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HetGNN reduces power consumption by 20-25\% and runs nearly 10,000 times faster than model-based benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |

Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph co\textbf{O}rdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |

As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.

We propose Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in settings with noisy relational structures.</p></details> |  |

Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications.

This paper proposes a nonparametric graphical model that addresses these limitations by accommodating heterogeneous graph structures without imposing any specific distributional assumptions. The proposed estimation method effectively integrates network embedding with nonparametric graphical model estimation. It further transforms the graph learning task into solving a finite-dimensional linear equation system by leveraging the properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Moreover, theoretical guarantees are established for the proposed method in terms of the estimation consistency and exact recovery of the heterogeneous graph structures. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated through a variety of simulated examples and a real application to the statistician coauthorship dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RDL models typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and reuse. In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level, link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations for relational data.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2506.22199</p></details> |

This article describes NuGraph2, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for low-level reconstruction of simulated neutrino interactions in a LArTPC detector. Simulated neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector geometry are described as heterogeneous graphs, with energy depositions on each detector plane forming nodes on planar subgraphs. The network utilizes a multi-head attention message-passing mechanism to perform background filtering and semantic labelling on these graph nodes, identifying those associated with the primary physics interaction with 98.0\% efficiency and labelling them according to particle type with 94.9\% efficiency. The network operates directly on detector observables across multiple 2D representations, but utilizes a 3D-context-aware mechanism to encourage consistency between these representations. Model inference takes 0.12~s/event on a CPU, and 0.005s/event batched on a GPU. This architecture is designed to be a general-purpose solution for particle reconstruction in neutrino physics, with the potential for deployment across a broad range of detector technologies, and offers a core convolution engine that can be leveraged for a variety of tasks beyond the two described in this article.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, published in Physical Review D</p></details> |

This heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various downstream tasks.

| **[NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution, resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator. As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of 49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture. Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of 2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models (Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain orchestration.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods isolate association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial Learning method between the association network view and different similarity views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in predicting potential drug-microbe associations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including subfigures), 1 table.

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.15299</p></details> |
| **[Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16754v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

These features are typically used as inputs to machine learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks, modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576 modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning in black-box optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |

We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |

Generally, one can determine if top-ranked products are related to the query by applying a similarity threshold; exceeding it deems the product relevant, otherwise manual revision is required. Despite being a well-known problem, the integration of these models in real-world systems is often overlooked. In particular, production systems have strong coverage requirements, i.e., a high proportion of recommendations must be automated. In this paper we propose ALC , an Auxiliary Learning strategy that boosts Coverage through learning fine-grained embeddings. Concretely, we introduce two training objectives that leverage the hardest negatives in the batch to build discriminative training signals between positives and negatives. We validate ALC using three extreme multi-label classification approaches in two product recommendation datasets; LF-AmazonTitles-131K and Tech and Durables (proprietary), demonstrating state-of-the-art coverage rates when combined with a recent threshold-consistent margin loss.</p></details> | SEPLN 2025 |

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Poster</p></details> |

Multi-source cross-domain recommendation (CDR) addresses these challenges by transferring valuable knowledge from multiple source domains to enhance recommendations in a target domain. However, existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based CDR methods typically rely on a single-agent framework, leading to negative transfer issues caused by inconsistent domain contributions and inherent distributional discrepancies among source domains. To overcome these limitations, MARCO, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cross-Domain recommendation framework, is proposed. It leverages cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent is dedicated to estimating the contribution from an individual source domain, effectively managing credit assignment and mitigating negative transfer. In addition, an entropy-based action diversity penalty is introduced to enhance policy expressiveness and stabilize training by encouraging diverse agents' joint actions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate MARCO's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

| **[Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Popularity Debiasing in Top-K Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04502v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures, while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted by the vast, generic dataset. This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing them from being overshadowed. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs, complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music) with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods, particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions. We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04239v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to capture user preferences by modeling sequential patterns in user-item interactions. However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM'25</p></details> |
| **[Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper has issues and has been restructured in the work; it is no longer suitable, so I am applying for withdrawal</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Review on Harnessing Large Language Models to Overcome Recommender System Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21117v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features. While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and user-centric recommender systems</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\% on Yelp datasets. The framework exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems often rely on dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g., "cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel, hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks. Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.</p></details> |  |

However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Examining directed self-placement with regression discontinuity analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03350v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many students, placement into developmental education becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Placing college students into developmental education significantly negatively impacts student attainment, student probability of passing, and college credits earned. To combat these negative effects, many universities are investigating alternative placement mechanisms. Could directed self-placement be an effective alternative mechanism? Do students who self-place suffer the same negative impacts from placement recommendations as their traditionally placed counterparts? This paper uses longitudinal data with causal inference methods to examine whether directed self-placement has similar negative impacts on student grades and pass rates as mandatory placement schema. We begin with an analysis of over 20,000 student placement records into one of two different placement tracks for first-year writing. Longitudinal and institutional data allow us to control for characteristic variables such as student race, family income, and sex. The results of our regression discontinuity design show that directed self-placement does not negatively impact student grades or pass rate. This may be an improvement for students who place at or near the threshold for developmental/remedial education; However, class, race, and gender-based statistical differences persist in the program at-large, demonstrating that placement technique plays only one part in building a more equitable program.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA). The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR</p></details> | MIWAI 2025 |

Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing shilling methods can generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning over User Preferences: Knowledge Graph-Augmented LLMs for Explainable Conversational Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14459v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by capturing user preferences through interactive dialogues. Explainability in CRSs is crucial as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, increasing system transparency and trustworthiness. However, current CRSs often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) or language models to extract and represent user preferences as latent vectors, which limits their explainability. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities that can bridge this gap by generating human-understandable preference summaries. However, effectively reasoning over user preferences in CRSs remains challenging as LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for analyzing user preferences. While KGs provide rich domain knowledge, integrating them with LLMs encounters a significant modality gap between structured KG information and unstructured conversations. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a plug-and-play framework that synergizes LLMs and KGs to reason over user preferences, enhancing the performance and explainability of existing CRSs. COMPASS employs a two-stage training approach: first, it bridges the gap between the structured KG and natural language through novel graph entity captioning pre-training. Next, COMPASS optimizes user preference reasoning via knowledge-aware instruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user preferences from dialogue histories and KG-augmented context. This enables COMPASS to perform knowledge-aware reasoning and generate interpretable user preferences that can seamlessly integrate with existing CRS models for improving recommendation performance and explainability. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPASS in improving various CRS models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies.

This paper introduces an enhanced generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent coordination.</p></details> |  |

Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</p></details> |  |

Given the strong interaction and reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging LLMs for CRSs has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, existing LLM-based methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, instead relying on unified prompts and the LLM's internal knowledge to decide how to interact, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO) method for CRS, which decomposes the process of generating strategy-driven response decisions into the macro-level strategy planning and micro-level strategy adaptation through a network-of-experts architecture. At the macro level, a Planner expert selects macro-level interaction strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage). At the micro level, an Actor expert generates detailed responses conditioned on the selected macro-level strategy, guided by auxiliary experts that provide complementary information such as user preferences and factual grounding. This hierarchical decomposition disentangles the optimization of different sub-tasks involved in CRS response generation, enabling more tractable learning at each level. To address the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn training data, we formulate strategy learning as a reinforcement learning problem, guided by an LLM-based reward model to achieve automatic strategy exploration. Extensive experiments show that RSO significantly improves interaction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit hierarchical strategy optimization for CRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing AI assistants offer help only after users describe their goals or problems, which can be effortful and imprecise. We present InvisibleMentor, a system that turns screen recordings of task completion into vision-grounded reflections on tasks. It detects issues such as repetitive edits and recommends more efficient alternatives based on observed behavior. Unlike prior systems that rely on logs, APIs, or user prompts, InvisibleMentor operates directly on screen recordings. It uses a two-stage pipeline: a vision-language model reconstructs actions and context, and a language model generates structured, high-fidelity suggestions. In evaluation, InvisibleMentor accurately identified inefficient workflows, and participants found its suggestions more actionable, tailored, and more helpful for learning and improvement compared to a prompt-based spreadsheet assistant.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Considering the real-time requirements, critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios. Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem, where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26063v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise, which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex. This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling -- thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios. PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and empirical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX.

Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at https://github.com/FrankenstLee/SemanticShield.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClustRecNet: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Clustering Algorithm Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25289v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.</p></details> |  |

However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval on the item page, and 15\% lift in add-to-cart using cart context-based ranker on the cart page. Our work contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for e-commerce systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025 EARL Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Neural Reranker for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18736v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For multi-stage recommenders in industry, a user request would first trigger a simple and efficient retriever module that selects and ranks a list of relevant items, then the recommender calls a slower but more sophisticated reranking model that refines the item list exposure to the user. To consistently optimize the two-stage retrieval reranking framework, most efforts have focused on learning reranker-aware retrievers. In contrast, there has been limited work on how to achieve a retriever-aware reranker. In this work, we provide evidence that the retriever scores from the previous stage are informative signals that have been underexplored. Specifically, we first empirically show that the reranking task under the two-stage framework is naturally a noise reduction problem on the retriever scores, and theoretically show the limitations of naive utilization techniques of the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework DNR that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. The resulting DNR solution extends the conventional score error minimization loss with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and an industrial recommender system, together with analytical support, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Item-Query Attention for Stable Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24424v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise, reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history. MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand ``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just ``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Bias in Spoken Dialogue LLMs for Real-World Decisions and Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02352v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age, gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.</p></details> |  |
| **[TATTOO: Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recOmmendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23242v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods. Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.</p></details> | 4 figures, 4 tables |
| **[WARBERT: A Hierarchical BERT-based Model for Web API Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23175v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M). Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements in accuracy and effiency.</p></details> |  |

To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+9.34%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+7.04%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Dialogue Generation for Interactive Conversational Elicitation & Recommendation (ICER)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02331v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynerGen: Contextualized Generative Recommender for Unified Search and Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21777v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce \textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generative Recommender, Recommendation System, Information Retrieval</p></details> |

While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

Human in the loop shortcomings can increase the risk of failures in recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20099v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today. Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection, curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop" paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability. However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or "compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.</p></details> |  |

KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20225v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Algorithm Selection for Recommender Systems: Meta-Learning via in-depth algorithm feature engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20134v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnifiedRL: A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Tailored for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17589v6)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the last pivotal stage of Recommender System (RS), Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model into a final score to maximize user satisfaction. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |

Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.

How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |

We present MusiCRS, the first benchmark for audio-centric conversational recommendation that links authentic user conversations from Reddit with corresponding audio tracks. MusiCRS contains 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz) with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS enables evaluation across three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query (multimodal), allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems rely heavily on textual signals and struggle with nuanced audio reasoning. This exposes fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration where models excel at dialogue semantics but cannot effectively ground abstract musical concepts in actual audio content. To facilitate progress, we release the MusiCRS dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/MusiCRS), evaluation code (https://github.com/rohan2810/musiCRS), and comprehensive baselines.</p></details> | 6 pages |

In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of hyperparameter tuning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RecSys 2025</p></details> |

However, lots of users' interests are sparse due to lacking consumption behaviors, making it challenging to provide accurate recommendations for them, which is widespread in large-scale RSs. In particular, efficiently solving this problem in the ranking stage of RS is an even greater challenge, which requires an end-to-end and real-time approach. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative method called Dynamic User Interest Augmentation (DUIA). DUIA enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by generating enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors through dynamic stream clustering of similar users and relevant items from multiple perspectives. To realize stream clustering, we specially design an algorithm called Gradient-based Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (GHCA) for DUIA, which performs clustering via gradient descent and stores the cluster centers in memory networks. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that DUIA not only significantly improves model performance for users with sparse interests but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end method, DUIA can be easily integrated with existing models. Furthermore, DUIA is also used for long-tail items and cold-start problem, which also yields excellent improvements. Since 2022, DUIA has been successfully deployed in multiple industrial RSs in Tencent and was made public in May 2024. Moreover, the thoughts behind DUIA, dynamic stream clustering and similarity-based enhancement, have inspired relevant works and have also been applied in other stages of RS.</p></details> |  |

In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise, which is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors. In classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of phenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment, serendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived as noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that identifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular, consisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item classification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items and signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that quantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher robustness in recommendation accuracy. Our approach aims to provide a cleaner training dataset that would inherently improve user satisfaction and engagement with Recommender Systems.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) possess the world knowledge and multimodal understanding needed for serendipity, but their integration into billion-item-scale platforms presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework where fine-tuned MLLMs provide high-level guidance to conventional recommendation models, steering them towards more serendipitous suggestions. This approach leverages MLLM strengths in understanding multimodal content and user interests while retaining the efficiency of traditional models for item-level recommendation. This mitigates the complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also demonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user interests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant yet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial short-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our MLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity and user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Recsys EARL Workshop</p></details> |

However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WISE 2025: 26th International Web Information Systems Engineering conference.

CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions, KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries, comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness, and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models.

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying and Upweighting Power-Niche Users to Mitigate Popularity Bias in Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17265v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been shown to exhibit popularity bias by over-recommending popular items and under-recommending relevant niche items. We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream" vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.</p></details> |  |

Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of email titles for millions of users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Second Workshop on Generative AI for E-commerce (GenAIECommerce '25), held September 22, 2025, in Prague, Czech Republic. 3 figures</p></details> |

Traditional models require intensive training, while LLMs offer flexible and generalizable zero-shot solutions but often generate generic or geographically irrelevant results due to missing trajectory and spatial context. To address these issues, we propose RALLM-POI, a framework that couples LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and self-rectification. We first propose a Historical Trajectory Retriever (HTR) that retrieves relevant past trajectories to serve as contextual references, which are then reranked by a Geographical Distance Reranker (GDR) for prioritizing spatially relevant trajectories. Lastly, an Agentic LLM Rectifier (ALR) is designed to refine outputs through self-reflection. Without additional training, RALLM-POI achieves substantial accuracy gains across three real-world Foursquare datasets, outperforming both conventional and LLM-based baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/LKRcrocodile/RALLM-POI.</p></details> | PRICAI 2025 |

However, most existing approaches rely on static user profiling, neglecting the temporal and dynamic nature of user interests. This limitation stems from a disconnect between language modelling and behaviour modelling, which constrains the capacity of agents to represent sequential patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Temporal-aware Agent-based simulator for Recommender Systems, DyTA4Rec, which enables agents to model and utilise evolving user behaviour based on historical interactions. DyTA4Rec features a dynamic updater for real-time profile refinement, temporal-enhanced prompting for sequential context, and self-adaptive aggregation for coherent feedback. Experimental results at group and individual levels show that DyTA4Rec significantly improves the alignment between simulated and actual user behaviour by modelling dynamic characteristics and enhancing temporal awareness in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional language model approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Recsys'25</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that rely on multimodal features for video content understanding, our method simulates users' sustained interest in watching short videos by learning collaborative information, using interest changes from existing positive and negative feedback videos and user interaction behaviors to implicitly model users' video watching journey. By segmenting videos based on duration and adopting a Transformer-like architecture, our method can capture sequential dependencies between segments while mitigating duration bias. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale and public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on watch time prediction tasks. The method has been deployed on Kuaishou Lite, achieving a significant improvement of +0.13\% in APP duration, and reaching an XAUC of 83\% for single video watch time prediction on industrial-scale streaming training sets, far exceeding other methods. The proposed method provides a scalable and effective solution for video recommendation through segment-level modeling and user engagement feedback.</p></details> |  |

Modeling the complex user preferences--which often exhibit a two-fold nature of static and dynamic interests--is critical for effective recommendations. However, the sparsity of out-of-town check-in data presents significant challenges in capturing such user preferences. Meanwhile, existing methods often conflate the static and dynamic preferences, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we for the first time systematically study the problem of out-of-town trip recommendation. A novel framework SPOT-Trip is proposed to explicitly learns the dual static-dynamic user preferences. Specifically, to handle scarce data, we construct a POI attribute knowledge graph to enrich the semantic modeling of users' hometown and out-of-town check-ins, enabling the static preference modeling through attribute relation-aware aggregation. Then, we employ neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to capture the continuous evolution of latent dynamic user preferences and innovatively combine a temporal point process to describe the instantaneous probability of each preference behavior. Further, a static-dynamic fusion module is proposed to merge the learned static and dynamic user preferences. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, showing that SPOT-Trip achieves performance improvement by up to 17.01%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Such big models are not only strong performers in practice but also offer a promising way to break out of the task-specific modeling restrictions, thereby enabling task-agnostic and unified ML systems. However, such a popular paradigm is mainly unexplored by the recommender systems (RS) community. A critical issue is that standard recommendation models are primarily built on categorical identity features. That is, the users and the interacted items are represented by their unique IDs, which are generally not shareable across different systems or platforms. To pursue the transferable recommendations, we propose studying pre-trained RS models in a novel scenario where a user's interaction feedback involves a mixture-of-modality (MoM) items, e.g., text and images. We then present TransRec, a very simple modification made on the popular ID-based RS framework. TransRec learns directly from the raw features of the MoM items in an end-to-end training manner and thus enables effective transfer learning under various scenarios without relying on overlapped users or items. We empirically study the transferring ability of TransRec across four different real-world recommendation settings. Besides, we look at its effects by scaling source and target data size. Our results suggest that learning neural recommendation models from MoM feedback provides a promising way to realize universal RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Function-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation: Definition, Annotation, and LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03945v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementary recommendations enhance the user experience by suggesting items that are frequently purchased together while serving different functions from the query item. Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary relationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining these labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such relationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs attempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and unreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs) to infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary classification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels (FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user purchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a human-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that it covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then evaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could accurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated complementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that even with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve high macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as gpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy (0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as effective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents FBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more accurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Purely Semantic Indexing for LLM-based Generative Recommendation and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16446v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic identifiers (IDs) have proven effective in adapting large language models for generative recommendation and retrieval. However, existing methods often suffer from semantic ID conflicts, where semantically similar documents (or items) are assigned identical IDs. A common strategy to avoid conflicts is to append a non-semantic token to distinguish them, which introduces randomness and expands the search space, therefore hurting performance. In this paper, we propose purely semantic indexing to generate unique, semantic-preserving IDs without appending non-semantic tokens. We enable unique ID assignment by relaxing the strict nearest-centroid selection and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms: exhaustive candidate matching (ECM) and recursive residual searching (RRS). Extensive experiments on sequential recommendation, product search, and document retrieval tasks demonstrate that our methods improve both overall and cold-start performance, highlighting the effectiveness of ensuring ID uniqueness.</p></details> |  |

To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side, there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal identity.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author Pairs for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16253v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems (RS) help users find interested content and connect authors with their target audience. Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -> follow -> gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have proposed methods to measure and mitigate such biases -- but translating academic theory into practice is inherently challenging. RS practitioners must balance the competing interests of diverse stakeholders, including providers and users, and operate in dynamic environments. Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the RS community, including HCI researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Outcome-Based Educational Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18186v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Real-World Aligned Benchmark for Unlearning in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17076v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems heavily leverage user interaction data to deliver personalized experiences. However, relying on personal data presents challenges in adhering to privacy regulations, such as the GDPR's "right to be forgotten". Machine unlearning (MU) aims to address these challenges by enabling the efficient removal of specific training data from models post-training, without compromising model utility or leaving residual information. However, current benchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec -- fail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on collaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket recommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore critical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design desiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic benchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering feedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple recommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and several unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS unlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that reflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests. We also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation setting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works for sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning requests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed unlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning algorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of only several seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Awareness in Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13957v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that formulates the recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast knowledge of large language models. However, existing studies focus on considering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal dynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time awareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to 15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets.

To simplify access to predefined AI services, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task instruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on smartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to receive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI tasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions; 2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones, offering a more seamless and efficient experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 6: Industry Track), ACL 2025.

| **[FLAME: A Serving System Optimized for Large-Scale Generative Recommendation with Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22681v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) models possess greater scaling power compared to traditional deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), yet they also impose a tremendous increase in computational burden. Measured in FLOPs, a typical GR model's workload sits in $10^9 \sim 10^{11}$ range, roughly four orders of magnitude higher than traditional DLRMs. Delivering accurate results in a few tens of milliseconds while processing billions of such requests per day puts extreme demands on the performance of the online serving system. Therefore, for industry practitioners, the alluring gains of GR models are tempered by the formidable challenge of online deployment at scale in production services. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive solution of online serving system tailored For Large-scale GenerAtive RecoMmendation with Efficiency (FLAME). Specifically, we leveraging CPU-GPU heterogeneous hardware to decouple feature pre-processing and model computation. We encapsulated several memory optimization features as the Proximal Data Accelerator (PDA) module to make full use of limited bandwidth and storage resources, which achieves a 1.9x throughput gain and a 1.7x latency reduction. We implement the Fused Kernel Engine (FKE) module based on the functionality and interface of NVIDIA TensorRT to boost model computation, delivering a speedup ratio of 4.6x-6.1x, throughput gain ratio of 4.7x-6.3x one step further. In addition, we design the Dynamic Stream Orchestrator (DSO) module to coordinate concurrent requests, enhancing the system throughput performance with 1.3x improvement in throughput and 2.3x speed-up under non-uniform distribution of upstream candidates. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our FLAME effectively supports large-scale online deployment of GR models and achieves remarkable improvements in system performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Data Augmentation for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13648v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems, predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences. A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless, in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and principled understanding of its effects. Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling. This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data construction in generative recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted at ACM TORS. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.08203</p></details> |

However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE 2025 Workshop. 4+1 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their efficiency as backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet) with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that, similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that balance local and global representations.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many neural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task. These models seek to make inferences based on their training data. Consequently, they better detect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle to detect those they have not. Developers seeking clones are, of course, interested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature review, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's goal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of different functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative LLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments reveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models. LLMs perform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone detection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up to 5% (average 3%) instead. We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive learning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen functionality. We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural language processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring similarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during training. We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a contrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive in-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between clones and non-clones. The F1 on clones of unseen functionality is improved by up to 26% (average 9%) for task-specific models and up to 5% (average 3%) for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication (to appear) in the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07389v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of cryo-EM processing tools is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches lack thorough biophysical modeling of heterogeneity and fail to reproduce the complex noise observed in real imaging. To address these limitations, we present CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that unifies versatile biophysical modeling with the first conditional cycle-consistent diffusion model tailored for cryo-EM. The biophysical engine provides multi-functional generation capabilities to capture authentic biological organization, and the diffusion model is enhanced with cycle consistency and mask-guided contrastive learning to ensure realistic noise while preserving structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoCCD generates structurally faithful micrographs, enhances particle picking and pose estimation, as well as achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, while also generalizing effectively to held-out protein families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808v4)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</p></details> |  |

Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios. In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation. Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more efficient alternative for this task.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Enhancing Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings via Knowledge-Driven Data Augmentation and Gaussian-Decayed Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12887v5)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[QGFace: Quality-Guided Joint Training For Mixed-Quality Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17494v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of a face crop in an image is decided by many factors such as camera resolution, distance, and illumination condition. This makes the discrimination of face images with different qualities a challenging problem in realistic applications. However, most existing approaches are designed specifically for high-quality (HQ) or low-quality (LQ) images, and the performances would degrade for the mixed-quality images. Besides, many methods ask for pre-trained feature extractors or other auxiliary structures to support the training and the evaluation. In this paper, we point out that the key to better understand both the HQ and the LQ images simultaneously is to apply different learning methods according to their qualities. We propose a novel quality-guided joint training approach for mixed-quality face recognition, which could simultaneously learn the images of different qualities with a single encoder. Based on quality partition, classification-based method is employed for HQ data learning. Meanwhile, for the LQ images which lack identity information, we learn them with self-supervised image-image contrastive learning. To effectively catch up the model update and improve the discriminability of contrastive learning in our joint training scenario, we further propose a proxy-updated real-time queue to compose the contrastive pairs with features from the genuine encoder. Experiments on the low-quality datasets SCface and Tinyface, the mixed-quality dataset IJB-B, and five high-quality datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recognizing face images of different qualities.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEaRL: Pathway-Enhanced Representation Learning for Gene and Pathway Expression Prediction from Histology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03455v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node), PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4 percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Pseudo-Supervised Contrast for Data-Free Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03375v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by CPSC-DFKD. The code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CPSC-DFKD.git</p></details> | 13 pages |

Several methods have been proposed to address this problem, leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA (Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment, aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity, and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https: //github.com/tienphat140205/XTRA.</p></details> | 2025 EMNLP Findings |

Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid-Collaborative Augmentation and Contrastive Sample Adaptive-Differential Awareness for Robust Attributed Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02731v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, deep reinforcement learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Considering the social impact of AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 - Reliable ML Workshop</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, existing methods often depend heavily on labeled data, use limited feature representations, and overlook temporal dynamics essential for accurate species identification. In this work, we propose a self-supervised contrastive network, ARIONet (Acoustic Representation for Interframe Objective Network), that jointly optimizes contrastive classification and future frame prediction using augmented audio representations. The model simultaneously integrates multiple complementary audio features within a transformer-based encoder model. Our framework is designed with two key objectives: (1) to learn discriminative species-specific representations for contrastive learning through maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same audio segment while pushing apart different samples, and (2) to model temporal dynamics by predicting future audio frames, both without requiring large-scale annotations. We validate our framework on four diverse birdsong datasets, including the British Birdsong Dataset, Bird Song Dataset, and two extended Xeno-Canto subsets (A-M and N-Z). Our method consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves classification accuracies of 98.41%, 93.07%, 91.89%, and 91.58%, and F1-scores of 97.84%, 94.10%, 91.29%, and 90.94%, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates low mean absolute errors and high cosine similarity, up to 95%, in future frame prediction tasks. Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our self-supervised learning strategy in capturing complex acoustic patterns and temporal dependencies, as well as its potential for real-world applicability in ecological conservation and monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Federated learning (FL) avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients, followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research.

While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets. We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection, ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform exact solutions.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Compressed Concatenation of Small Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04626v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Representation Learning for Customized Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04564v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-NeurIPS-CRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14715v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit, human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoME: Mixture of Matryoshka Experts for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04136v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), but their high computational demands and sensitivity to token granularity limit their practicality in resource-constrained settings. Token compression methods can reduce inference cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically. However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression, and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR, and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for resource-aware speech recognition.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Previous methods typically learn transferable interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it. However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary) and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors, avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG over Tables: Hierarchical Memory Index, Multi-Stage Retrieval, and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v4)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with an external knowledge base to improve the answer relevance and accuracy. In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Link: https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Generative Oversampling Using an Entropy-Guided Conditional Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25334v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate. Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN. We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas. Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |

To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools. As explicit graphs are not inherent to MTS data, graph generation becomes a critical first step in adapting GNNs to this domain. However, existing approaches often rely solely on the data itself for MTS graph generation, leaving them vulnerable to biases from small training datasets. This limitation hampers their ability to construct effective graphs, undermining the accurate modeling of underlying dependencies in MTS data and reducing GNN performance in this field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, K-Link, leveraging the extensive universal knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce biases for powered MTS graph generation. To harness the knowledge within LLMs, such as physical principles, we design and extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph} that captures universal knowledge of sensors and their linkage. To empower MTS graph generation with the knowledge-link graph, we further introduce a graph alignment module that transfers universal knowledge from the knowledge-link graph to the graph generated from MTS data. This enhances the MTS graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of K-Link for superior performance on various MTS tasks.</p></details> |  |

While supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments. Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only 50% of the labeled data from the target game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 21st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings. We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.</p></details> |  |

Yet most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node), PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4 percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce CVSM (Contrastive Vocal Similarity Modeling), a contrastive self-supervised procedure for music signal representation learning in the audio domain that can be utilized for musical and vocal similarity modeling. Our method operates under a contrastive framework, maximizing the similarity between vocal excerpts and musical mixtures containing the same vocals; we devise both a label-informed protocol, leveraging artist identity information to sample the contrastive pairs, and a label-agnostic scheme, involving artificial mixture creation from randomly sampled vocal and accompaniment excerpts, which are paired with vocals from the same audio segment. We evaluate our proposed method in measuring vocal similarity both objectively, through linear probing on a suite of appropriate downstream tasks, and subjectively, via conducting a user study consisting of pairwise comparisons between different models in a recommendation-by-query setting. Our results indicate that the representations learned through CVSM are effective in musical and vocal similarity modeling, outperforming numerous baselines across both isolated vocals and complete musical mixtures. Moreover, while the availability of artist identity labels during pre-training leads to overall more consistent performance both in the evaluated downstream tasks and the user study, a label-agnostic CVSM variant incorporating hybrid pre-training with real and artificial mixtures achieves comparable performance to the label-informed one in artist identification and perceived vocal similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 tables, 8 figures.

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original paper has issues and has been restructured in the work; it is no longer suitable, so I am applying for withdrawal</p></details> |

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Representation Learning for Effective Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12784v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. The source code is available at https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/CRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid-Collaborative Augmentation and Contrastive Sample Adaptive-Differential Awareness for Robust Attributed Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02731v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PGMEL: Policy Gradient-based Generative Adversarial Network for Multimodal Entity Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02726v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PointAD+: Learning Hierarchical Representations for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03277v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

While classical methods like Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add (WSOLA) provide strong baselines, they often introduce artifacts under non-stationary or extreme stretching conditions. We propose STSM-FILM - a fully neural architecture that incorporates Feature-Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to condition the model on a continuous speed factor. By supervising the network using WSOLA-generated outputs, STSM-FILM learns to mimic alignment and synthesis behaviors while benefiting from representations learned through deep learning. We explore four encoder-decoder variants: STFT-HiFiGAN, WavLM-HiFiGAN, Whisper-HiFiGAN, and EnCodec, and demonstrate that STSM-FILM is capable of producing perceptually consistent outputs across a wide range of time-scaling factors. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of FiLM-based conditioning to improve the generalization and flexibility of neural TSM models.</p></details> |  |

Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Web: ...</summary><p>Web: https://dongsuleetech.github.io/projects/IWoL/</p></details> |

Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Poster).

However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

Considering the social impact of AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 - Reliable ML Workshop</p></details> |

However, current deep learning models use new principles for unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data. However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.</p></details> |  |

Spatial structure is fundamental to effective geospatial intelligence systems; however, existing foundation models often lack the flexibility to reason about places, context-rich regions spanning multiple spatial granularities that may consist of many spatially and semantically related points of interest. To address this gap, we propose PlaceFM, a geospatial foundation model that captures place representations through a training-free, clustering-based approach. PlaceFM summarizes the entire point of interest graph constructed from U.S. Foursquare data, producing general-purpose region embeddings while automatically identifying places of interest. These embeddings can be directly integrated into geolocation data pipelines to support a variety of urban downstream tasks. Without the need for costly pre-training, PlaceFM provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Extensive experiments on two real-world prediction tasks, ZIP code-level population density and housing prices, demonstrate that PlaceFM not only outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial foundation models but also achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mohammadhashemii/PlaceFM.</p></details> |  |

However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing partitions tend to rely on isotropic cells, fixed global resolution, or balanced constraints, which fragment dense regions and merge unrelated points in sparse ones, thereby increasing the candidate count when probing only a few cells. Our method instead partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into anisotropic Gaussian cells whose shapes align with local geometry and sizes adapt to data density. Information-theoretic objectives balance coverage, overlap, and geometric alignment, while split/clone refinement introduces Gaussians only where needed. At query time, Mahalanobis distance selects relevant cells and localized quantization prunes candidates. This yields partitions that reduce cross-cell neighbor splits and candidate counts under small probe budgets, while remaining robust even when trained on only a small fraction of the dataset. Overall, GARLIC introduces a geometry-aware space-partitioning paradigm that combines information-theoretic objectives with adaptive density refinement, offering competitive recall--efficiency trade-offs for Euclidean ANN search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

In this work, we introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives. We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies.

We introduce BioBlobs, a plug-and-play, fully differentiable module that represents proteins by dynamically partitioning structures into flexibly-sized, non-overlapping substructures ("blobs"). The resulting blobs are quantized into a shared and interpretable codebook, yielding a discrete vocabulary of function-relevant protein substructures used to compute protein embeddings. We show that BioBlobs representations improve the performance of widely used protein encoders such as GVP-GNN across various PRL tasks. Our approach highlights the value of architectures that directly capture function-relevant protein substructures, enabling both improved predictive performance and mechanistic insight into protein function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning as Mutual Information Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01345v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network, stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound, we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization, making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.</p></details> |  |

Our framework exhibits several desirable characteristics, including the ability to express dynamics on evolving graphs without piecewise integration, the capability to calibrate trajectories with subsequent data, and robustness to missing observations.

We formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.</p></details> |  |

Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIRTUE: Visual-Interactive Text-Image Universal Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00523v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |

As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential. Code is available in https://github.com/ZhanliangAaronWang/FR-CCA-ADNI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cutting the Skip: Training Residual-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00345v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'25. 22 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Fine-Grained Category Discovery with Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26227v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2) Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%.

| **[EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting, with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fairness-Performance Pareto Front Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17643v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution. In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods. Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, contain link to package.

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI 2025; 17 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables; Project Page at https://ldkong.com/LargeAD</p></details> |

First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation. KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses, and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency. Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate through dedicated analysis.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 3 figures |

Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, we use the Qwen3 Embedding model to derive a compact yet expressive feature representation; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of diverse modalities presents substantial challenges to achieve effective cross-modal collaboration and integration. To address this, we introduce DecAlign, a novel hierarchical cross-modal alignment framework designed to decouple multimodal representations into modality-unique (heterogeneous) and modality-common (homogeneous) features. For handling heterogeneity, we employ a prototype-guided optimal transport alignment strategy leveraging gaussian mixture modeling and multi-marginal transport plans, thus mitigating distribution discrepancies while preserving modality-unique characteristics. To reinforce homogeneity, we ensure semantic consistency across modalities by aligning latent distribution matching with Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularization. Furthermore, we incorporate a multimodal transformer to enhance high-level semantic feature fusion, thereby further reducing cross-modal inconsistencies. Our extensive experiments on four widely used multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DecAlign consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across five metrics. These results highlight the efficacy of DecAlign in enhancing superior cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency while preserving modality-unique features, marking a significant advancement in multimodal representation learning scenarios.

However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations.

| **[Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25094v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/AHHHZ975/Semantic-Visibility-UV-Param.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional discriminative features that directly optimize posterior and thus emphasize semantic abstraction while losing fine grained details, audio generation models inherently encode both spatiotemporal perception (capturing local acoustic texture across time and frequency) and semantic prior (knowing what to generate). It motivates us to explore the bridge of these complementary strengths. We provide a systematic investigation of their differences and complementary relationships, and ultimately propose an effective fusion strategy. Experiments across multiple tasks, including sound event classification, tagging, and particularly the fine grained task of audio captioning, demonstrate consistent performance gains. Beyond empirical improvements, this work more importantly introduces a new perspective on audio representation learning, highlighting that generative discriminative complementarity can provide both detailed perception and semantic awareness for audio understanding.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization, proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient, single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves the geometric properties of the embedding space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category Discovery: An Open-World Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22542v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery, skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object scenarios. Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of the category discovery literature at https://github.com/Visual-AI/Category-Discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the on-demand worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation, allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic, immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Compression via Multimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24431v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore, their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/jk-sounds/ScatterAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[REALIGN: Regularized Procedure Alignment with Matching Video Embeddings via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24382v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking JEPA: Compute-Efficient Video SSL with Frozen Teachers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24317v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[PEARL: Performance-Enhanced Aggregated Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24312v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning is a key technique in modern machine learning that enables models to identify meaningful patterns in complex data. However, different methods tend to extract distinct aspects of the data, and relying on a single approach may overlook important insights relevant to downstream tasks. This paper proposes a performance-enhanced aggregated representation learning method, which combines multiple representation learning approaches to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The framework is designed to be general and flexible, accommodating a wide range of loss functions commonly used in machine learning models. To ensure computational efficiency, we use surrogate loss functions to facilitate practical weight estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our method asymptotically achieves optimal performance in downstream tasks, meaning that the risk of our predictor is asymptotically equivalent to the theoretical minimum. Additionally, we derive that our method asymptotically assigns nonzero weights to correctly specified models. We evaluate our method on diverse tasks by comparing it with advanced machine learning models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods, showing its effectiveness and broad applicability in real-world machine learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[PartSAM: A Scalable Promptable Part Segmentation Model Trained on Native 3D Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21965v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects, recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data. Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets, providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://czvvd.github.io/PartSAMPage/</p></details> |
| **[ELASTIQ: EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24302v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces. The code and pre-trained weights will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[DHG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Deep Hypergraph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12244v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep graph models have achieved great success in network representation learning. However, their focus on pairwise relationships restricts their ability to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this issue, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNNs, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and multi-dimensional empirical analysis impedes deeper understanding and further development of HNN research. While several toolkits for deep hypergraph learning (DHGL) have been introduced to facilitate algorithm evaluation, they provide only limited quantitative evaluation results and insufficient coverage of advanced algorithms, datasets, and benchmark tasks. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HNNs. Specifically, DHG-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. We comprehensively evaluate 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms on 22 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, under unified experimental settings. Extensive experiments reveal both the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. Furthermore, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. The DHG-Bench library is available at: https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Encoding for Improved Representation Learning over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02758v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Big Data in September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters. The code, data, and models will be publicly available to facilitate academic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
