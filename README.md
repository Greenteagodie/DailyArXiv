| **[HERO: Heterogeneous Continual Graph Learning via Meta-Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17458v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[MGTS-Net: Exploring Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16350v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHAN: Object-Level Privacy Detection via Inference on Scene Heterogeneous Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09172v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.</p></details> | <details><summary>I wou...</summary><p>I would like to formally request the withdrawal of my manuscript from arXiv.

| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Causal Disentanglement Learning for Accurate Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11084v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 Figures, |
| **[D3MAS: Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute for Enhanced Knowledge Sharing in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10585v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy by 46\% on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Semantics & Structure for Software Vulnerability Detection using Hybrid Network Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10321v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors. Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable, explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights, facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, 14 equations, accepted at the 14th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications (COMPLEX NETWORKS 2025) and the conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Studies in Computational Intelligence series</p></details> |
| **[HeSRN: Representation Learning On Heterogeneous Graphs via Slot-Aware Retentive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09767v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Database Distillation: From Structured Tables to Condensed Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06980v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) underpin the majority of global data management systems, where information is structured into multiple interdependent tables. To effectively use the knowledge within RDBs for predictive tasks, recent advances leverage graph representation learning to capture complex inter-table relations as multi-hop dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead and excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the computational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables. To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e., utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoRE-GNN: Multi-omics Data Integration with a Heterogeneous Graph Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06880v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI via RST-Enhanced Graph Fusion and Interpretability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12324v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference. Our code and datasets are available at "https://github.com/Leonardo123-ui/CDCL_NLI" for peer review.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main (Camera Ready)</p></details> |
| **[Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRouter: A Knowledge-Graph-Guided LLM Router for Collaborative Multi-Agent Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05445v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms. Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[LHGEL: Large Heterogeneous Graph Ensemble Learning using Batch View Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03432v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from large heterogeneous graphs presents significant challenges due to the scale of networks, heterogeneity in node and edge types, variations in nodal features, and complex local neighborhood structures. This paper advocates for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation, residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning. Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Transmission Grid Topology Control: Busbar Information Asymmetry and Heterogeneous Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factors such as the proliferation of renewable energy and electrification contribute to grid congestion as a pressing problem. Topology control is an appealing method for relieving congestion, but traditional approaches for topology discovery have proven too slow for practical application. Recent research has focused on machine learning (ML) as an efficient alternative. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for topology control applications due to their ability to model the graph structure of power grids. This study investigates the effect of the graph representation on GNN effectiveness for topology control. We identify the busbar information asymmetry problem inherent to the popular homogeneous graph representation. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation that resolves this problem. We apply GNNs with both representations and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) baseline on an imitation learning task. The models are evaluated by classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution network configurations, followed by FCNNs, and lastly, homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution network configurations than FCNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures.

| **[VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |
| **[IoDResearch: Deep Research on Private Heterogeneous Data via the Internet of Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01553v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management. Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation. Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | 8 pages,4 figures |
| **[UrbanGraph: Physics-Informed Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Heterogeneous Graphs for Urban Microclimate Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00457v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hazy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Physical Priors and Graph-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24020v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Long-Range Information Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23660v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively.

| **[Think-on-Graph 3.0: Efficient and Adaptive LLM Reasoning on Heterogeneous Graphs via Multi-Agent Dual-Evolving Context Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21710v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures, they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |
| **[AI-Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Measurement of Technological Convergence through Heterogeneous Graph and Semantic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21187v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.</p></details> |  |

We identify a new vulnerability, LLMs generating convincing career trajectories in fake resumes and explore effective detection methods. To address this challenge, we construct a dataset of machine-generated career trajectories using LLMs and various methods, and demonstrate that conventional text-based detectors perform poorly on structured career data. We propose CareerScape, a novel heterogeneous, hierarchical multi-layer graph framework that models career entities and their relations in a unified global graph built from genuine resumes. Unlike conventional classifiers that treat each instance independently, CareerScape employs a structure-aware framework that augments user-specific subgraphs with trusted neighborhood information from a global graph, enabling the model to capture both global structural patterns and local inconsistencies indicative of synthetic career paths. Experimental results show that CareerScape outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8-85.0% relatively, highlighting the importance of structure-aware detection for machine-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

However, the data suffers from missing values that hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available https://github.com/hyLiu1994/MH-GIN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures; This paper is accepted by PVLDB 2026</p></details> |
| **[Clinical Multi-modal Fusion with Heterogeneous Graph and Disease Correlation Learning for Multi-Disease Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15852v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-disease diagnosis using multi-modal data like electronic health records and medical imaging is a critical clinical task. Although existing deep learning methods have achieved initial success in this area, a significant gap persists for their real-world application. This gap arises because they often overlook unavoidable practical challenges, such as modality missingness, noise, temporal asynchrony, and evidentiary inconsistency across modalities for different diseases. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGDC-Fuse, a novel framework that constructs a patient-centric multi-modal heterogeneous graph to robustly integrate asynchronous and incomplete multi-modal data. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous graph learning module to aggregate multi-source information, featuring a disease correlation-guided attention layer that resolves the modal inconsistency issue by learning disease-specific modality weights based on disease correlations. On the large-scale MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets, HGDC-Fuse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Optimize Capacity Planning in Semiconductor Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15767v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines, trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions. Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Acoustic event Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14893v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal acoustic event classification plays a key role in audio-visual systems. Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top K Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Attacks on Heterogeneous Graph Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01964v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Large Language Models for Data Challenges in Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18475v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction. While graph learning has achieved remarkable progress, real-world graph data presents a number of challenges that significantly hinder the learning process. In this survey, we focus on four fundamental data-centric challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey focuses on how LLMs can address four fundamental data-centric challenges in graph-structured data, thereby improving the effectiveness of graph learning. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

| **[Deep Temporal Graph Networks for Real-Time Correction of GNSS Jamming-Induced Deviations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14000v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are increasingly disrupted by intentional jamming, degrading availability precisely when positioning and timing must remain operational. We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction. We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |

Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fraud detection and risk assessment of online payment transactions on e-commerce platforms based on LLM and GCN frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09928v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of e-commerce, online payment fraud has become increasingly complex, posing serious threats to financial security and consumer trust. Traditional detection methods often struggle to capture the intricate relational structures inherent in transactional data. This study presents a novel fraud detection framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively identify fraudulent activities in e-commerce online payment transactions. A dataset of 2,840,000 transactions was collected over 14 days from major platforms such as Amazon, involving approximately 2,000 U.S.-based consumers and 30 merchants. With fewer than 6000 fraudulent instances, the dataset represents a highly imbalanced scenario. Consumers and merchants were modeled as nodes and transactions as edges to form a heterogeneous graph, upon which a GCN was applied to learn complex behavioral patterns. Semantic features extracted via GPT-4o and Tabformer were integrated with structural features to enhance detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.98, effectively balancing precision and sensitivity in fraud detection. This framework offers a scalable and real-time solution for securing online payment environments and provides a promising direction for applying graph-based deep learning in financial fraud prevention.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is in proceedings of the 34th IJCAI Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have extended prediction techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</p></details> |  |

When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |

Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge.

| **[HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02481v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management, as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g., rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences, thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97), improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer, demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words, stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection, which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted to CIKM'25 |
| **[Space-aware Socioeconomic Indicator Inference with Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14135v4)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regional socioeconomic indicators are critical across various domains, yet their acquisition can be costly. Inferring global socioeconomic indicators from a limited number of regional samples is essential for enhancing management and sustainability in urban areas and human settlements. Current inference methods typically rely on spatial interpolation based on the assumption of spatial continuity, which does not adequately address the complex variations present within regional spaces. In this paper, we present GeoHG, the first space-aware socioeconomic indicator inference method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph-based structure to represent geospace for non-continuous inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in comparison to existing methods, achieving an $R^2$ score exceeding 0.8 under extreme data scarcity with a masked ratio of 95\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM S...</summary><p>ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025 Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[GOSU: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Global-Level Optimized Semantic Unit-Centric Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00449v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[BridgeShield: Enhancing Security for Cross-chain Bridge Applications via Heterogeneous Graph Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20517v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield, a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

The model is trained and evaluated using major benchmark datasets: Sanger GDSC, NCI60, and Broad CTRP, which cover a wide range of drugs and cancer cell lines. drGT demonstrates AUROC of up to 94.5% under random splitting, 84.4% for unseen drugs, and 70.6% for unseen cell lines, comparable to existing benchmark methods while also providing interpretability. Regarding interpretability, we review drug-gene co-occurrences by text-mining PubMed abstracts for high-coefficient genes mentioning particular drugs. Across 976 drugs from NCI60 with known drug-target interactions (DTIs), model predictions utilized both known DTIs (36.9%) as well as additional predictive associations, many supported by literature. In addition, we compare the drug-gene associations identified by drGT with those from an established DTI prediction model and find that 63.67% are supported by either PubMed literature or predictions from the DTI model. Further, we describe the utilization of ACs to identify affected biological processes by each drug via enrichment analyses, thereby enhancing biological interpretability.

| **[Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

Traditional computational approaches often struggle to capture the complex relationships among drugs, targets, and biological entities. In this work, we propose HGNN-DDI, a heterogeneous graph neural network model designed to predict potential DDIs by integrating multiple drug-related data sources. HGNN-DDI leverages graph representation learning to model heterogeneous biomedical networks, enabling effective information propagation across diverse node and edge types. Experimental results on benchmark DDI datasets demonstrate that HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to support safer drug development and precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Effective Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17388v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning models. In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages.

| **[DR-CircuitGNN: Training Acceleration of Heterogeneous Circuit Graph Neural Network on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16769v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small, medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Heterogeneous Text-Attributed Graphs on Catalytic Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15392v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures, |

Experimental results indicate that AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction (SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of 33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the best-performing models.</p></details> |  |

While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Attributes and Multi-Scale Structures for Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13911v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Multi-View Graph Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12377v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view graph data, which both captures node attributes and rich relational information from diverse sources, is becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains. The effective and efficient retrieval of such data is an important task. Although multi-view hashing techniques have offered a paradigm for fusing diverse information into compact binary codes, they typically assume attributes-based inputs per view. This makes them unsuitable for multi-view graph data, where effectively encoding and fusing complex topological information from multiple heterogeneous graph views to generate unified binary embeddings remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Contrastive Multi-view Graph Hashing (CMGHash), a novel end-to-end framework designed to learn unified and discriminative binary embeddings from multi-view graph data. CMGHash learns a consensus node representation space using a contrastive multi-view graph loss, which aims to pull $k$-nearest neighbors from all graphs closer while pushing away negative pairs, i.e., non-neighbor nodes. Moreover, we impose binarization constraints on this consensus space, enabling its conversion to a corresponding binary embedding space at minimal cost. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CMGHash significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Detecting misinformation in short videos is challenging due to their multi-modal nature and the limited context of individual videos. While recent methods focus on analyzing content signals-visual, textual, and audio-they often overlook implicit relationships among videos, uploaders, and events. To address this gap, we propose DugFND (Dual-community graph for fake news detection), a novel method that enhances existing video classifiers by modeling two key community patterns: (1) uploader communities, where uploaders with shared interests or similar content creation patterns group together, and (2) event-driven communities, where videos related to the same or semantically similar public events form localized clusters. We construct a heterogeneous graph connecting uploader, video, and event nodes, and design a time-aware heterogeneous graph attention network to enable effective message passing. A reconstruction-based pretraining phase further improves node representation learning. DugFND can be applied to any pre-trained classifier. Experiments on public datasets show that our method achieves significant performance gains, demonstrating the value of dual-community modeling for fake news detection in short videos.</p></details> | in submission |

However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics.

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted tp CIKM 2025</p></details> |

In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for more expressive and semantically rich encodings. In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values. Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In practical scenarios involving heterogeneous distributed graph data, personalized Federated Graph Learning (pFGL) aims to enhance model utility by training personalized models tailored to client needs. However, existing pFGL methods often require numerous communication rounds under heterogeneous graphs, leading to significant communication overhead and security concerns. While One-shot Federated Learning (OFL) enables collaboration in a single round, existing OFL methods are designed for image-centric tasks and are ineffective for graph data, leaving a critical gap in the field. Additionally, personalized models derived from existing methods suffer from bias, failing to effectively generalize to the minority. To address these challenges, we propose the first \textbf{O}ne-shot \textbf{p}ersonalized \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{G}raph \textbf{L}earning method (\textbf{O-pFGL}) for node classification, compatible with Secure Aggregation protocols for privacy preservation. Specifically, for effective graph learning in one communication round, our method estimates and aggregates class-wise feature distribution statistics to construct a global surrogate graph on the server, facilitating the training of a global graph model. To mitigate bias, we introduce a two-stage personalized training approach that adaptively balances local personal information and global insights from the surrogate graph, improving both personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments on 14 diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Bottleneck-Guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Interpretable Neurodevelopmental Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20769v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Structure Sharing Empowers Multi-task Heterogeneous GNNs for Customer Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22089v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer expansion, i.e., growing a business existing customer base by acquiring new customers, is critical for scaling operations and sustaining the long-term profitability of logistics companies. Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automatic database O&M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBAIO...</summary><p>DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20 real-world scenarios, covering domains like finance, energy, and healthcare.

| **[Quality-of-Service Aware LLM Routing for Edge Computing with Multiple Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00234v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model, GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%, respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/GCL-GCN</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20980v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Hypergraph Networks for Multimodal Sequence Data Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00926v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex classification tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Masked Language Models are Good Heterogeneous Graph Generalizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06157v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

While successful in text and image domains, synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity. In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation. To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains: system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset.

However, most existing models focus only on direct similarity in homogeneous graphs, failing to exploit the rich similarity in heterogeneous graphs. To address this gap, inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL) module, learning global similarity through an affinity-enhanced drug-target graph, and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL) module, capturing higher-order similarity by amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors using an even-polynomial graph filter based on balance theory. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively capture similarity information across multiple interaction scales within affinity and association matrices. To address the issue of imbalance in DTI datasets, we propose an adjustable imbalance loss function that adjusts the weight of negative samples by the parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SOC-DGL consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Moreover, SOC-DGL successfully predicts the top 9 drugs known to bind ABL1, and further analyzed the 10th drug, which has not been experimentally confirmed to interact with ABL1, providing supporting evidence for its potential binding.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures (including subfigures), 5 tables.

PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites (LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI), energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV (IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework. It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |

However, the neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by structure dependency in HGNNs makes it challenging to deploy for latency-constrained applications that require fast inference. Inspired by recent GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation frameworks, we introduce HG2M and HG2M+ to combine both HGNN's superior performance and MLP's efficient inference. HG2M directly trains student MLPs with node features as input and soft labels from teacher HGNNs as targets, and HG2M+ further distills reliable and heterogeneous semantic knowledge into student MLPs through reliable node distillation and reliable meta-path distillation. Experiments conducted on six heterogeneous graph datasets show that despite lacking structural dependencies, HG2Ms can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and significantly outperform vanilla MLPs. Moreover, HG2Ms demonstrate a 379.24$\times$ speedup in inference over HGNNs on the large-scale IGB-3M-19 dataset, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |

Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts.

Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Graph Integration for Cross-Domain Recommendation via Heterogeneous Graph Coordinators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11719v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, users typically interact with diverse items across multiple domains (e.g., e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social networks), generating intricate heterogeneous interaction graphs. Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph co\textbf{O}rdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

| **[HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |

As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

However, training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph. Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer. Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph. CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models for representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of DAC2025</p></details> |

We propose Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in settings with noisy relational structures.</p></details> |  |

Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables (planned submission to Machine Learning Science and Technology)</p></details> |
| **[RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications.

Such choices, however, often require balancing complex trade-offs between environmental impact, cost, convenience, and personal interests. To address this, we present the SmartSustain Recommender, a web application designed to nudge users toward eco-friendlier options through an interactive, user-centric interface. The system visualizes the broader consequences of travel decisions by combining CO2e emissions, destination popularity, and seasonality with personalized interest matching. It employs mechanisms such as interactive city cards for quick comparisons, dynamic banners that surface sustainable alternatives in specific trade-off scenarios, and real-time impact feedback using animated environmental indicators.

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[On Efficiency-Effectiveness Trade-off of Diffusion-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17245v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process. However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems.

To improve recommender systems, platforms frequently rely on creator-side randomized experiments to evaluate algorithm updates. We show that commonly adopted difference-in-means estimators can lead to severely biased estimates due to recommender interference, where treated and control creators compete for exposure. This bias can result in incorrect business decisions. To address this, we propose a ``recommender choice model'' that explicitly represents the interference pathway. The approach combines a structural choice framework with neural networks to account for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. Building on this foundation, we develop a debiased estimator using the double machine learning (DML) framework to adjust for errors from nuisance component estimation. We show that the estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal, and we extend the DML theory to handle correlated data, which arise in our context due to overlapped items. We validate our method with a large-scale field experiment on Weixin short-video platform, using a costly double-sided randomization design to obtain an interference-free ground truth. Our results show that the proposed estimator successfully recovers this ground truth, whereas benchmark estimators exhibit substantial bias, and in some cases, yield reversed signs.</p></details> |  |

This paper discusses the consequences of such recommendation on market concentration and inequality. Binary types denoting a statistical majority and minority are noisily revealed through a statistical experiment. The achievable utilities and recommendation shares for the two groups can be analyzed as a Bayesian Persuasion problem. While under arbitrary noise structures, effects on concentration compared to a full-information market are ambiguous, under symmetric noise, concentration increases and consumer welfare becomes more unequal. We define symmetric statistical experiments and analyze persuasion under a restriction to such experiments, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Layout Is the Model: On Action-Item Coupling in Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16804v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g., watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action given item" and (P3) no information leakage. While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens) naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving. Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both accurate and efficient.</p></details> |  |

The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness to sub-populations due to the varying user properties. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in enhancing RS performance, their practical applicability is hindered by high costs, inference latency, and degraded performance on long user queries. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework designed to promote social good by equitably serving all user groups. By adopting a two-phase approach, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task. We evaluate our hybrid framework by incorporating eight different recommendation algorithms and three different LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness to subpopulations without disproportionately escalating costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.00824</p></details> |

However, research in this area has been persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025) from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems.

However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems?

Nevertheless, a crucial challenge is transforming recommendation data into the language space of LLMs through effective item tokenization. Current approaches, such as ID, textual, and codebook-based identifiers, exhibit shortcomings in encoding semantic information, incorporating collaborative signals, or handling code assignment bias. To address these limitations, we propose LETTER (a LEarnable Tokenizer for generaTivE Recommendation), which integrates hierarchical semantics, collaborative signals, and code assignment diversity to satisfy the essential requirements of identifiers. LETTER incorporates Residual Quantized VAE for semantic regularization, a contrastive alignment loss for collaborative regularization, and a diversity loss to mitigate code assignment bias. We instantiate LETTER on two models and propose a ranking-guided generation loss to augment their ranking ability theoretically. Experiments on three datasets validate the superiority of LETTER, advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of LLM-based generative recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Large Language Models as Recommendation Systems with Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15647v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations. The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies. Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose, we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BPL: Bias-adaptive Preference Distillation Learning for Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16076v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests.

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models, WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales, MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by \textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and commercial outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Safe and Human-Aligned Game Conversational Recommendation via Multi-Agent Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20094v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have advanced with large language models, showing strong results in domains like movies. These domains typically involve fixed content and passive consumption, where user preferences can be matched by genre or theme. In contrast, games present distinct challenges: fast-evolving catalogs, interaction-driven preferences (e.g., skill level, mechanics, hardware), and increased risk of unsafe responses in open-ended conversation. We propose MATCHA, a multi-agent framework for CRS that assigns specialized agents for intent parsing, tool-augmented retrieval, multi-LLM ranking with reflection, explanation, and risk control which enabling finer personalization, long-tail coverage, and stronger safety. Evaluated on real user request dataset, MATCHA outperforms six baselines across eight metrics, improving Hit@5 by 20%, reducing popularity bias by 24%, and achieving 97.9% adversarial defense. Human and virtual-judge evaluations confirm improved explanation quality and user alignment.</p></details> | IMCL MAS |
| **[A Simulation Framework for Studying Systemic Effects of Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14857v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Causality Enhancement for Cross-Domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14641v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical value in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[GemiRec: Interest Quantization and Generation for Multi-Interest Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14626v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations: the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then, we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c) Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its practical value in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Purity and Diversity in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation from the Frequency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20427v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance. Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some experiments in the paper have not been sufficiently validated, leading to conclusions that lack robustness.

| **[Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03941v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns - stability - and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes - plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity. Although additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Integration and Discrepancy Resolution of Contextualized Knowledge for Personalized Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14257v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has revealed promising potential through their capacity to extract world knowledge for enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, current methodologies that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and personalized adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyMiRec: A Hybrid Multi-interest Learning Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13738v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for sequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[I$^3$-MRec: Invariant Learning with Information Bottleneck for Incomplete Modality Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04247v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by integrating complementary semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2025 Accepted</p></details> |

This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages |

This study presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically, we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment. In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by 50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM RecSys 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

To overcome the lack of annotated reasoning data, we design RecPO, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning and recommendation jointly with a novel fused reward mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that R$^2$ec outperforms traditional, LLM-based, and reasoning-augmented recommender baselines, while further analyses validate its competitive efficiency among conventional LLM-based recommender baselines and strong adaptability to diverse recommendation scenarios.

| **[TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the TMLR journal</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests, and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time, we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional controls.</p></details> |  |

The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference.

| **[Causal Inspired Multi Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12325v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases: (i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii) interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12211v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However, applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly across different backbone families and scales.

We present FLARKO (Financial Language-model for Asset Recommendation with Knowledge-graph Optimization), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to generate asset recommendations that are both profitable and behaviorally aligned. FLARKO encodes users' transaction histories and asset trends as structured KGs, providing interpretable and controllable context for the LLM. To demonstrate the adaptability of our approach, we develop and evaluate both a centralized architecture (CenFLARKO) and a federated variant (FedFLARKO). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of combining KTO for fine-tuning of LLMs for financial asset recommendation. We also present the first use of structured KGs to ground LLM reasoning over behavioral financial data in a federated learning (FL) setting. Evaluated on the FAR-Trans dataset, FLARKO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines on behavioral alignment and joint profitability, while remaining interpretable and resource-efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12054v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneRec-Think: In-Text Reasoning for Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11639v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful generative capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a paradigm shift in recommendation. However, existing generative models (e.g., OneRec) operate as implicit predictors, critically lacking the capacity for explicit and controllable reasoning-a key advantage of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose OneRec-Think, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates dialogue, reasoning, and personalized recommendation. OneRec-Think incorporates: (1) Itemic Alignment: cross-modal Item-Textual Alignment for semantic grounding; (2) Reasoning Activation: Reasoning Scaffolding to activate LLM reasoning within the recommendation context; and (3) Reasoning Enhancement, where we design a recommendation-specific reward function that accounts for the multi-validity nature of user preferences. Experiments across public benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our proposed "Think-Ahead" architecture enables effective industrial deployment on Kuaishou, achieving a 0.159\% gain in APP Stay Time and validating the practical efficacy of the model's explicit reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity. By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Inherited Popularity Bias in Cold-Start Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11402v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems struggle with making predictions on unseen, or 'cold', items. Systems designed to address this challenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to leverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction data. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods, cold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases. In this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a common cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to more popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting rarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the popularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely: because they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead attempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to significant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to popular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through experiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this behavior on three generative cold-start methods. We then describe a simple post-processing bias mitigation method that, by using embedding magnitude as a proxy for predicted popularity, can produce more balanced recommendations with limited harm to user-oriented cold-start accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[Next Interest Flow: A Generative Pre-training Paradigm for Recommender Systems by Modeling All-domain Movelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11317v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a cornerstone of modern recommender systems, has been dominated by discriminative models that react to past user behavior rather than proactively modeling user intent. Existing generative paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact, delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MVIGER: Multi-View Variational Integration of Complementary Knowledge for Generative Recommender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) have been widely used in recommender systems to incorporate textual information of items into item IDs, leveraging their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recently, generative recommender systems have utilized the reasoning abilities of LMs to directly generate index tokens for potential items of interest based on the user's interaction history. To inject diverse item knowledge into LMs, prompt templates with detailed task descriptions and various indexing techniques derived from diverse item information have been explored. This paper focuses on the inconsistency in outputs generated by variations in input prompt templates and item index types, even with the same user's interaction history. Our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals that preference knowledge learned from diverse prompt templates and heterogeneous indices differs significantly, indicating a high potential for complementarity. To fully exploit this complementarity and provide consistent performance under varying prompts and item indices, we propose MVIGER, a unified variational framework that models selection among these information sources as a categorical latent variable with a learnable prior. During inference, this prior enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant source or aggregate predictions across multiple sources, thereby ensuring high-quality recommendation across diverse template-index combinations. We validate the effectiveness of MVIGER on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing generative recommender baselines through the effective integration of complementary knowledge.</p></details> |  |

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Poster</p></details> |

However, current research in MSR faces two significant challenges that hinder the field's development: the absence of uniform procedures for multi-scenario dataset processing, thus hindering fair comparisons, and most models being closed-sourced, which complicates comparisons with current SOTA models. Consequently, we introduce our benchmark, \textbf{Scenario-Wise Rec}, which comprises 6 public datasets and 12 benchmark models, along with a training and evaluation pipeline. Additionally, we validated the benchmark using an industrial advertising dataset, reinforcing its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios. We aim for this benchmark to offer researchers valuable insights from prior work, enabling the development of novel models based on our benchmark and thereby fostering a collaborative research ecosystem in MSR.

| **[Does LLM Focus on the Right Words? Diagnosing Language Bias in LLM-based Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates language bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAMUR: Hyper Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06217v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) has gained significant attention in recent years, which leverages data from multiple domains to enhance their performance concurrently.However, current MDR models are confronted with two limitations. Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them. Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model Hyper Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation (HAMUR). Specifically, HAMUR consists of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2023</p></details> |
| **[HatLLM: Hierarchical Attention Masking for Enhanced Collaborative Modeling in LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10955v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on leveraging large language models (LLMs) for sequential recommendation. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in inferring users' nuanced preferences through fine-grained semantic reasoning. However, they also exhibit a notable limitation in effectively modeling collaborative signals, i.e., behavioral correlations inherent in users' historical interactions. Our empirical analysis further reveals that the attention mechanisms in LLMs tend to disproportionately focus on tokens within the same item, thereby impeding the capture of cross-item correlations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hierarchical attention masking strategy for LLM-based recommendation, termed HatLLM. Specifically, in shallow layers, HatLLM masks attention between tokens from different items, facilitating intra-item semantic understanding; in contrast, in deep layers, HatLLM masks attention within items, thereby compelling the model to capture cross-item correlations. This progressive, layer-wise approach enables LLMs to jointly model both token-level and item-level dependencies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HatLLM achieves significant performance gains (9.13% on average) over existing LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art approaches, which aim to minimize changes in product aspects while reversing their recommended decisions according to an aggregated decision boundary score, often lead to factual inaccuracies in explanations. To solve this problem, in this work we propose a novel method of Comparative Counterfactual Explanations for Recommendation (CoCountER). CoCountER creates counterfactual data based on soft swap operations, enabling explanations for recommendations of arbitrary pairs of comparative items. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10564v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user interests in historical interaction sequences. Historical interaction sequences often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise. Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise, limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long-Term User Welfare in Recommender Systems via Creator-Oriented Information Revelation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10511v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the long-term user welfare (e.g., sustained user engagement) has become a central objective of recommender systems (RS). In real-world platforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in shaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the effective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS ecosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that heuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when embedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with the short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established economics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach without relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information from an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can effectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by this idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term Welfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we utilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion) to map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators as the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption of traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information revelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm trained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators. Extensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information revealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.</p></details> |  |

When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix factorization for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of the Web Conference (WWW) 2025 (11 pages)</p></details> |

Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.</p></details> | 41 pages |

It plays a crucial role in determining the final exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative reranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model complex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from the "likelihood trap", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as low-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of high-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user engagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative Recommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the likelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture diverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the decoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by implicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we design a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling the model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Moreover, Congrats has been evaluated on a large-scale video-sharing app, Kuaishou, with over 300 million daily active users, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves both recommendation quality and diversity, validating our effectiveness in practical industrial environments.</p></details> |  |

The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |

To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.</p></details> |  |

While cross-attention is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300 experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter. We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in multi-modal research.</p></details> | 19 pages |

GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UIST 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation.

In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias. Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Data Augmentation in Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09129v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms, from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model. The code is available at: https://github.com/MrYansong/GDA4Rec.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that \ourname{} consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WWW 2026.

Building on this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Makes LLMs Effective Sequential Recommenders? A Study on Preference Intensity and Temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02261v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems aspire to profile users by interpreting their interaction histories, echoing how humans make decisions by weighing experience, relative preference strength, and situational relevance. Yet, existing large language model (LLM)-based recommenders often fall short of mimicking the flexible, context-aware decision strategies humans exhibit, neglecting the structured, dynamic, and context-aware mechanisms fundamental to human behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose RecPO, a preference optimization framework that models structured feedback and contextual delay to emulate human-like prioritization in sequential recommendation. RecPO exploits adaptive reward margins based on inferred preference hierarchies and temporal signals, enabling the model to favor immediately relevant items and to distinguish between varying degrees of preference and aversion. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate that RecPO not only yields performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, but also mirrors key characteristics of human decision-making: favoring timely satisfaction, maintaining coherent preferences, and exercising discernment under shifting contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15695v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</p></details> |  |

Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Really Need SFT? Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MDT4Rec, an offline RLRS framework that builds on the Decision Transformer (DT) to address two major challenges: learning from sub-optimal histories and representing complex user-item interactions. First, MDT4Rec shifts the trajectory stitching procedure from the training phase to action inference, allowing the system to shorten its historical context when necessary and thereby ignore negative or unsuccessful past experiences. Second, MDT4Rec initializes DT with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for knowledge transfer, replaces linear embedding layers with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for more flexible representations, and employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune only a small subset of parameters. We evaluate MDT4Rec on five public datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Long-Term User Behavior Prediction in Reinforcement Learning-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12815v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RL4RS) have gained attention for their ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

Recommendation systems are a critical application domain poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs, continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching this framework to billions of users in YouTube.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data, however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions. Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, these signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users' intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent, discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention, while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for responsible AI development.</p></details> |  |

| **[From What to Why: Thought-Space Recommendation with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08626v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models (SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented question answering. Our code is available \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Thinking_PULSE-0FC5/README.md}{here}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The Workshop on AI for Music, Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS-AI4Music)</p></details> |

Traditional machine learning classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing: (1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper is under review</p></details> |

Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries. Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences. Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods.</p></details> |  |

Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First, we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature. Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Although federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving recommendations, its impact on diversity remains unclear. We introduce FedFlex, a two-stage framework that combines local, on-device fine-tuning of matrix factorization models (SVD and BPR) with a lightweight Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking step to promote diversity. We conducted the first live user study of a federated recommender, collecting behavioral data and feedback during a two-week online deployment. Our results show that FedFlex successfully engages users, with BPR outperforming SVD in click-through rate. Re-ranking with MMR consistently improved ranking quality (nDCG) across both models, with statistically significant gains, particularly for BPR. Diversity effects varied: MMR increased coverage for both models and improved intra-list diversity for BPR, but slightly reduced it for SVD, suggesting different interactions between personalization and diversification across models. Our exit questionnaire responses indicated that most users expressed no clear preference between re-ranked and unprocessed lists, implying that increased diversity did not substantially reduce user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, the interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations, this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework, designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in the Asia Pacific Region (SIGIR-AP 2025), December 7--10, 2025, Xi'an, China</p></details> |
| **[AgentDR Dynamic Recommendation with Implicit Item-Item Relations via LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05598v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination, scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an automated framework for research article classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org dataset spanning more than three decades, we evaluate multiple feature extraction approaches (TF--IDF, Count Vectorizer, Sentence-BERT, USE, Mirror-BERT) in combination with diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with TF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 69\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation module based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling efficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly addresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and demonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted in Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2025)</p></details> |

(2024). The original authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[Fine-grained auxiliary learning for real-world product recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04551v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product recommendation is the task of recovering the closest items to a given query within a large product corpora. Generally, one can determine if top-ranked products are related to the query by applying a similarity threshold; exceeding it deems the product relevant, otherwise manual revision is required. Despite being a well-known problem, the integration of these models in real-world systems is often overlooked. In particular, production systems have strong coverage requirements, i.e., a high proportion of recommendations must be automated. In this paper we propose ALC , an Auxiliary Learning strategy that boosts Coverage through learning fine-grained embeddings. Concretely, we introduce two training objectives that leverage the hardest negatives in the batch to build discriminative training signals between positives and negatives. We validate ALC using three extreme multi-label classification approaches in two product recommendation datasets; LF-AmazonTitles-131K and Tech and Durables (proprietary), demonstrating state-of-the-art coverage rates when combined with a recent threshold-consistent margin loss.</p></details> | SEPLN 2025 |
| **[MARCO: A Cooperative Knowledge Transfer Framework for Personalized Cross-domain Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04508v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems frequently encounter data sparsity issues, particularly when addressing cold-start scenarios involving new users or items. Multi-source cross-domain recommendation (CDR) addresses these challenges by transferring valuable knowledge from multiple source domains to enhance recommendations in a target domain. However, existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based CDR methods typically rely on a single-agent framework, leading to negative transfer issues caused by inconsistent domain contributions and inherent distributional discrepancies among source domains. To overcome these limitations, MARCO, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cross-Domain recommendation framework, is proposed. It leverages cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent is dedicated to estimating the contribution from an individual source domain, effectively managing credit assignment and mitigating negative transfer. In addition, an entropy-based action diversity penalty is introduced to enhance policy expressiveness and stabilize training by encouraging diverse agents' joint actions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate MARCO's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

| **[Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Popularity Debiasing in Top-K Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04502v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures, while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted by the vast, generic dataset. This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing them from being overshadowed. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs, complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music) with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods, particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Applications of State Space Models and Advanced Training Techniques in Sequential Recommendations: A Comparative Study on Efficiency and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05606v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.07691 by other authors</p></details> |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions. We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Denoising Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Model Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04239v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to capture user preferences by modeling sequential patterns in user-item interactions. However, these models are often influenced by noise such as accidental interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, to reduce the effect of noise, some works propose explicitly identifying and removing noisy items. However, we find that simply relying on collaborative information may result in an over-denoising problem, especially for cold items. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework: Interest Alignment for Denoising Sequential Recommendation (IADSR) which integrates both collaborative and semantic information. Specifically, IADSR is comprised of two stages: in the first stage, we obtain the collaborative and semantic embeddings of each item from a traditional sequential recommendation model and an LLM, respectively. In the second stage, we align the collaborative and semantic embeddings and then identify noise in the interaction sequence based on long-term and short-term interests captured in the collaborative and semantic modalities. Our extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its compatibility with different sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM2025 |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

| **[Intelligent Communication Mixture-of-Experts Boosted-Medical Image Segmentation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17684v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

Conventional landmark-based methods face a fundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low distinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult stable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the challenge of descriptively identifying a unique "signature" (local point cloud) by leveraging a detectable, high-precision "anchor" (like a pole). To solve this, we propose a novel canonical representation, "Pole-Image," as a hybrid method that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding 3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding environment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image with the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's nature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the "relative geometry" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The key advantage of pole landmarks is that "detection" is extremely easy. This ease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the automatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive pairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes "Contrastive Learning (CL)" applicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly discriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor overcomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The high-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing to map maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, technical report</p></details> |

Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

| **[Boosting Graph Robustness Against Backdoor Attacks: An Over-Similarity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01272v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in tasks such as social and transportation networks. However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, raising significant concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, existing defense methods face two main challenges: either the inability to establish a clear distinction between triggers and clean nodes, resulting in the removal of many clean nodes, or the failure to eliminate the impact of triggers, making it challenging to restore the target nodes to their pre-attack state. Through empirical analysis of various existing graph backdoor attacks, we observe that the triggers generated by these methods exhibit over-similarity in both features and structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel graph backdoor defense method SimGuard. We first utilizes a similarity-based metric to detect triggers and then employs contrastive learning to train a backdoor detector that generates embeddings capable of separating triggers from clean nodes, thereby improving detection efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method effectively defends against various graph backdoor attacks while preserving performance on clean nodes. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After discussions with one of the co-authors, it was decided that this version should not be made public at this time.

Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.</p></details> | 31 pages,3 figures |

This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision.

| **[Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in CLIP via Reconstruction and Alignment of Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16540v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences. Implementation codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as an EMNLP'25 main paper</p></details> |

Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA) that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL) selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views, S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |

Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGRouter: Learning to Route Queries to Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23052v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations, exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings, covering open and closed-source LLMs, show that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM and existing routing methods. With an extended score-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints.

Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |
| **[MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</p></details> |  |

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.</p></details> |  |

However, practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data -- let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts.

| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Following the Autoregressive Nature of LLM Embeddings via Compression and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11401v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new trend uses LLMs as dense text encoders via contrastive learning. However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG.

We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</p></details> |  |

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</p></details> |  |

Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

This leads to a self-reinforcing cycle of mismatched results and trial-and-error reformulation. To address this, we study the task of generating user-facing natural language query intent descriptions that surface what the system likely inferred the query to mean, based on post-retrieval evidence. We propose QUIDS, a method that leverages dual-space contrastive learning to isolate intent-relevant information while suppressing irrelevant content. QUIDS combines a dual-encoder representation space with a disentangling decoder that works together to produce concise and accurate intent descriptions. Enhanced by intent-driven hard negative sampling, the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across ROUGE, BERTScore, and human/LLM evaluations. Our qualitative analysis confirms QUIDS' effectiveness in generating accurate intent descriptions for exploratory search.

| **[Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13735v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[RelTopo: Multi-Level Relational Modeling for Driving Scene Topology Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13553v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

| **[Seeing and Knowing in the Wild: Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition with Large-scale Knowledge Graphs via Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13675v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.</p></details> |  |
| **[MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ReasoningShield: Safety Detection over Reasoning Traces of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17244v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) leverage transparent reasoning traces, known as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), to break down complex problems into intermediate steps and derive final answers. However, these reasoning traces introduce unique safety challenges: harmful content can be embedded in intermediate steps even when final answers appear benign. Existing moderation tools, designed to handle generated answers, struggle to effectively detect hidden risks within CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce ReasoningShield, a lightweight yet robust framework for moderating CoTs in LRMs. Our key contributions include: (1) formalizing the task of CoT moderation with a multi-level taxonomy of 10 risk categories across 3 safety levels, (2) creating the first CoT moderation benchmark which contains 9.2K pairs of queries and reasoning traces, including a 7K-sample training set annotated via a human-AI framework and a rigorously curated 2.2K human-annotated test set, and (3) developing a two-stage training strategy that combines stepwise risk analysis and contrastive learning to enhance robustness. Experiments show that ReasoningShield achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming task-specific tools like LlamaGuard-4 by 35.6% and general-purpose commercial models like GPT-4o by 15.8% on benchmarks, while also generalizing effectively across diverse reasoning paradigms, tasks, and unseen scenarios.

| **[Contrastive Learning-Based Dependency Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13368v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space. Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC, while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

| **[GRACE: Globally-Seeded Representation-Aware Cluster-Specific Evolution for Compiler Auto-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13176v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiler pass selection and phase ordering present a significant challenge in achieving optimal program performance, particularly for objectives like code size reduction. Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but often yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all nature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its prohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches promise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen programs. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler auto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE effectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a weighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences and a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass sequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate similarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a coreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to unseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset sequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on seven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an average of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz, while incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[VCTR: A Transformer-Based Model for Non-parallel Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12964v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-parallel voice conversion aims to convert voice from a source domain to a target domain without paired training data. Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have been used for this task, but these models suffer from difficult training and unsatisfactory results. Later, Contrastive Voice Conversion (CVC) was introduced, utilizing a contrastive learning-based approach to address these issues. However, these methods use CNN-based generators, which can capture local semantics but lacks the ability to capture long-range dependencies necessary for global semantics. In this paper, we propose VCTR, an efficient method for non-parallel voice conversion that leverages the Hybrid Perception Block (HPB) and Dual Pruned Self-Attention (DPSA) along with a contrastive learning-based adversarial approach. The code can be found in https://github.com/Maharnab-Saikia/VCTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMG-UP: Unsupervised Personalization in Cross-User EMG Gesture Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21589v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-user electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition represents a fundamental challenge in achieving scalable and personalized human-machine interaction within real-world applications. Despite extensive efforts, existing methodologies struggle to generalize effectively across users due to the intrinsic biological variability of EMG signals, resulting from anatomical heterogeneity and diverse task execution styles. To address this limitation, we introduce EMG-UP, a novel and effective framework for Unsupervised Personalization in cross-user gesture recognition. The proposed framework leverages a two-stage adaptation strategy: (1) Sequence-Cross Perspective Contrastive Learning, designed to disentangle robust and user-specific feature representations by capturing intrinsic signal patterns invariant to inter-user variability, and (2) Pseudo-Label-Guided Fine-Tuning, which enables model refinement for individual users without necessitating access to source domain data. Extensive evaluations show that EMG-UP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods by at least 2.0% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[IP-Augmented Multi-Modal Malicious URL Detection Via Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancement and Multi-Granularity Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12395v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious URL detection remains a critical cybersecurity challenge as adversaries increasingly employ sophisticated evasion techniques including obfuscation, character-level perturbations, and adversarial attacks. Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown potential for URL analysis tasks, three limitations persist in current implementations: (1) inability to effectively model the non-natural hierarchical structure of URLs, (2) insufficient sensitivity to character-level obfuscation, and (3) lack of mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary network-level signals such as IP addresses-all essential for robust detection. To address these challenges, we propose CURL-IP, an advanced multi-modal detection framework incorporating three key innovations: (1) Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancer, which enhances subword token representations through token-aware contrastive learning to produce more discriminative and isotropic embeddings; (2) Cross-Layer Multi-Scale Aggregator, employing hierarchical aggregation of Transformer outputs via convolutional operations and gated MLPs to capture both local and global semantic patterns across layers; and (3) Blockwise Multi-Modal Coupler that decomposes URL-IP features into localized block units and computes cross-modal attention weights at the block level, enabling fine-grained inter-modal interaction. This architecture enables simultaneous preservation of fine-grained lexical cues, contextual semantics, and integration of network-level signals. Our evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets shows the framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06970v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot named entity recognition can identify new types of named entities based on a few labeled examples. Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.</p></details> |  |
| **[DFAMS: Dynamic-flow guided Federated Alignment based Multi-prototype Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20353v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

| **[Can Representation Gaps Be the Key to Enhancing Robustness in Graph-Text Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12087v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphShaper: Geometry-aware Alignment for Improving Transfer Learning in Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12085v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20 percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce \textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Misinformation Recognition with Incomplete Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Misinformation Recognition has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of misinformation recognition in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.</p></details> |  |

However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing data augmentation-based contrastive learning, with a focus on SimCLR as a representative example. Our approach is based on the concept of \emph{approximate sufficient statistics}, which we extend beyond its original definition in \cite{oko2025statistical} for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using KL-divergence. We generalize it to equivalent forms and general f-divergences, and show that minimizing SimCLR and other contrastive losses yields encoders that are approximately sufficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these near-sufficient encoders can be effectively adapted to downstream regression and classification tasks, with performance depending on their sufficiency and the error induced by data augmentation in contrastive learning. Concrete examples in linear regression and topic classification are provided to illustrate the broad applicability of our results.</p></details> |  |

MammoDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore, while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often overlooked during embedding training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities.

| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Local Manifold Learning for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19247v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods typically overlook local manifold structures, leading to compromised discriminative capabilities in perceptual quality evaluation. To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness. Patches from different images also act as inter-class negatives to enhance feature separation. Additionally, we introduce a mutual learning strategy to improve the model's ability to recognize and prioritize visually important regions. Comprehensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PLCC of 0.942 on TID2013 (compared to 0.908) and 0.977 on CSIQ (compared to 0.965).</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Music Sample Identification with Multi-Track Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11507v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning as Representation: Rethinking Visual Reinforcement Learning in Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11369v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Identity Signals in Conversational Facial Dynamics via Disentangled Expression Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11223v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Prototypes based Contrastive Learning for Classifying Multi-Label and Fine-Grained Educational Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11204v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names' vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rohit-gupta/MMContrast/tree/main/APPROVE</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2023</p></details> |

However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities, resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data availability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Source-Free Object Detection with Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11090v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |

We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations. The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

We present InstructUE, an instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations. InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space, thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Joint Learning Approach to Hardware Caching and Prefetching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10862v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ML for Systems Workshop at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for physiological signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Text-to-Image Generation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Semantic Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10633v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture, portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score (0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives. Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10564v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user interests in historical interaction sequences. Historical interaction sequences often contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the performance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised methods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by predicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise labels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise. Additionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise driven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise, limiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with Weakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS first introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the original and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes weakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical interaction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising module with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item representations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the ground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised interest representations. Finally, based on the denoised item and interest representations, MGSD-WSS predicts the next item. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequence recommendation and denoising models. Our code is available at https://github.com/lalunex/MGSD-WSS.</p></details> |  |

Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, Plus Appendices, EACL 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.</p></details> |  |

A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.</p></details> |  |

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This field has seen significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames. Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

However, despite their ability to generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries, introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.</p></details> |  |

Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Sentence, Two Embeddings: Contrastive Learning of Explicit and Implicit Semantic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09293v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

A key obstacle to improving their reliability is the severe scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for error attribution, as existing resources rely on costly and unscalable manual annotation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Aegis, a novel framework for Automated error generation and attribution for multi-agent systems. Aegis constructs a large dataset of 9,533 trajectories with annotated faulty agents and error modes, covering diverse MAS architectures and task domains. This is achieved using a LLM-based manipulator that can adaptively inject context-aware errors into successful execution trajectories. Leveraging fine-grained labels and the structured arrangement of positive-negative sample pairs, Aegis supports three different learning paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. We develop learning methods for each paradigm. Comprehensive experiments show that trained models consistently achieve substantial improvements in error attribution. Notably, several of our fine-tuned LLMs demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary models an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model.

Spoofing, one of the most covert and deceptive TBM strategies, exhibits complex anomaly patterns across multilevel prices, while often being simplified as a single-level manipulation. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation architecture with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel manipulation and the contributions of key components for detection, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex time series data.</p></details> |  |

Existing models have limited spatial perception, often exhibiting structural hallucinations and texture distortion in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating knowledge from language models and external databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine texture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and texture-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ICCV 2025 (Highlight).

However, existing methods often struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages.

| **[On the Alignment Between Supervised and Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08852v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their objectives?} We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with training time. Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning.

Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 8 figures, survey paper</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment, Mining and Fusion: Representation Alignment with Hard Negative Mining and Selective Knowledge Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08791v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions. Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels, modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.</p></details> | CVPR2025 Paper |
| **[Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15695v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often struggle with cold users who have limited interaction data. Engaging these users is crucial for platform growth. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging the social-relation graph to enrich interest representations from behavior-based models. However, extracting value from social graphs is challenging due to relation noise and cross-domain inconsistency. To address the noise propagation and obtain accurate social interest, we employ a dual-view denoising strategy, employing low-rank SVD to the user-item interaction matrix for a denoised social graph and contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. Addressing the interest inconsistency between social and behavioral interests, we adopt a "mutual distillation" technique to isolate the original interests into aligned social/behavior interests and social/behavior specific interests, maximizing the utility of both. Experimental results on widely adopted industry datasets verify the method's effectiveness, particularly for cold users, offering a fresh perspective for future research. The implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaze on the Prize: Shaping Visual Attention with Return-Guided Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08442v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://andrewcwlee.github.io/gaze-on-the-prize</p></details> |

The substantial computational demands required for training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.</p></details> |  |

This can lead to overfitting under noisy data, particularly when expressive models are used (e.g., the energy-based model in Implicit BC). To address this, we extend behavior cloning into an iterative process of optimal action estimation within the Interactive Imitation Learning framework. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive policy Learning from Interactive Corrections (CLIC). CLIC leverages human corrections to estimate a set of desired actions and optimizes the policy to select actions from this set. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments validate CLIC's advantages over existing state-of-the-art methods, including stable training of energy-based models, robustness to feedback noise, and adaptability to diverse feedback types beyond demonstrations.

Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks.

We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised foundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external supervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning (SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous self-supervised learning methods have been proposed to address this challenge, a significant class of these approaches aligns the covariance or correlation matrix with the identity matrix. Despite impressive performance across various downstream tasks, these methods often suffer from biased sample risk, leading to substantial optimization shifts in mini-batch settings and complicating theoretical analysis. In this paper, we introduce a novel \underline{\bf Adv}ersarial \underline{\bf S}elf-\underline{\bf S}upervised Representation \underline{\bf L}earning (Adv-SSL) for unbiased transfer learning with no additional cost compared to its biased counterparts. Our approach not only outperforms the existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets but is also supported by comprehensive end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Our analysis reveals that the minimax optimization in Adv-SSL encourages representations to form well-separated clusters in the embedding space, provided there is sufficient upstream unlabeled data. As a result, our method achieves strong classification performance even with limited downstream labels, shedding new light on few-shot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings.

Remote sensing offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently, self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning (multi-label) classification and regression.

To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Learning-to-Detect-51CB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn due to an accidental duplicate submission.

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nearest-Class Mean and Logits Agreement for Wildlife Open-Set Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17338v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit, or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish animals.

To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories, without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at NeurIPS (2025) Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we take an alternative approach to enhance the generalization and robustness of MLLMs under distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of multiple MLLMs on open-ended and closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45 datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a minimal sufficient representation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Large-scale User Game Lifecycle Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15412v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms. Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games. Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a 0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose deep Fr\'echet neural networks (DFNNs), an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting non-Euclidean responses -- which are considered as random objects in a metric space -- from Euclidean predictors. Our method leverages the representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of approximating conditional Fr\'echet means of the response given the predictors, the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a Fr\'echet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRecon: Graph-Level Representation Learning for 3D Molecules via Reconstruction-Based Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13174v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has powered major advances in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative examples including masked language modeling and next-token prediction. In molecular representation learning, however, pretraining tasks remain largely restricted to node-level denoising, which effectively captures local atomic environments but is often insufficient for encoding the global molecular structure critical to graph-level property prediction tasks such as energy estimation and molecular regression. To address this gap, we introduce GeoRecon, a graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon formulates a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to produce an informative graph representation that guides geometry reconstruction while inducing smoother and more transferable latent spaces. This encourages the learning of coherent, global structural features beyond isolated atomic details. Without relying on external supervision, GeoRecon generally improves over backbone baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks including QM9, MD17, MD22, and 3BPA, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-level reconstruction for holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Influence Component Analysis: A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Mixture Identifiability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17040v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias" that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization, largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism. Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness, particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16988v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Generalizable Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16914v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

However, current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning. This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans) encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD, combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark.

This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We provide a theoretical characterization of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary value, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately. Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCALAR: Self-Calibrating Adaptive Latent Attention Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16474v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration, enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships. Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Unlike approaches that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal relationships and improving model robustness.

MLCPD contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers, MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema, language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval. Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema.

Integrating hyperedge disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in genetic pathways (hyperedges).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.</p></details> |  |

Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[FSRF: Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery for Incomplete Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16086v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding. Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability. To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework (FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task. Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous, modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate constraint paradigms for representation learning. Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing modalities.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Existing evaluations often rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels, temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.

As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, Camera-ready, EMBC 2025</p></details> |

However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline.

| **[When Does Closeness in Distribution Imply Representational Similarity? An Identifiability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03784v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback--Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models with near-maximum data likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations -- a phenomenon mirrored in our experiments with models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results thus clarify the link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with ID-Content Modality Alignment for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10556v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) models often capture user preferences based on the historically interacted item IDs, which usually obtain sub-optimal performance when the interaction history is limited. Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

While existing embedding methods effectively preserve local similarity measures, they often fail to capture global functions like graph distances. Inspired by Bourgain's seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings of metric spaces (1985), we study the performance of local distance-preserving node embeddings. Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes called landmarks. Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger real-world networks, offering a scalable and transferable alternative for graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Landm...</summary><p>Landmark-based embeddings preserve global distances in graphs more efficiently; on Erdos-Renyi random graphs they need lower dimensions, and GNNs generalize these embeddings to large real-world networks</p></details> |

However, its application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP2025</p></details> |

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights.

Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

However, practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data -- let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts.

Traditional detection systems often fail to identify these unseen anomalies due to their reliance on in-distribution data. Domain generalization addresses this gap by leveraging knowledge from multiple known domains to detect out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce a multi-task representation learning technique that fuses information across related domains into a unified latent space. By jointly optimizing classification, reconstruction, and mutual information regularization losses, our method learns a minimal(bottleneck), domain-invariant representation that discards spurious correlations. This latent space decorrelation enhances generalization, enabling the detection of anomalies in unseen domains. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-day or novel anomaly detection across diverse anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  |

LiDAR generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's eye-view scene representation that facilitates joint scene predictions without relying on manual labeling unlike commonly used trajectory prediction frameworks. Prior approaches have optimized deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures directly in grid cell space. While these methods have achieved some degree of success in prediction, they occasionally grapple with unrealistic and incorrect predictions. We claim that the quality and realism of the forecasted occupancy grids can be enhanced with the use of generative models. We propose a framework that decouples occupancy prediction into: representation learning and stochastic prediction within the learned latent space. Our approach allows for conditioning the model on other available sensor modalities such as RGB-cameras and high definition maps. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is readily transferable between different robotic platforms on the real-world NuScenes, Waymo Open, and a custom dataset we collected on an experimental vehicle platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We recommend referring to the peer-reviewed and updated version of this approach, available at arXiv:2407.21126</p></details> |

We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories.

| **[Programmatic Representation Learning with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3 algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and understood.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/gpoesia/leapr/</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order interactions of multi-layer prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09394v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has successfully evolved in representation learning. While current prompt-tuning methods often introduce learnable prompts, they predominantly treat prompts as isolated, independent components across different network layers. This overlooks the complex and synergistic higher-order interactions that exist between prompts at various hierarchical depths, consequently limiting the expressive power and semantic richness of the prompted model. To address this fundamental gap, we propose a novel framework that explicitly models the Higher-order Interactions of Multi-layer Prompt. Our approach conceptualizes prompts from different layers not as separate entities, but as a cohesive system where their inter-relationships are critical. We design an innovative interaction module that captures these sophisticated, non-linear correlations among multi-layer prompts, effectively modeling their cooperative effects. This allows the model to dynamically aggregate and refine prompt information across the network's depth, leading to a more integrated and powerful prompting strategy. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, by leveraging these higher-order interactions, consistently surpasses state-of-the-art prompt-tuning baselines. The performance advantage is particularly pronounced in few-shot scenarios, validating that capturing the intricate interplay between multi-layer prompts is key to unlocking more robust and generalizable representation learning.</p></details> | under review |

While recent efforts have focused on explaining graph model decisions, the interpretability of unsupervised node embeddings remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiSeNE (Disentangled and Self-Explainable Node Embedding), a framework that generates self-explainable embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Our method employs disentangled representation learning to produce dimension-wise interpretable embeddings, where each dimension is aligned with distinct topological structure of the graph. We formalize novel desiderata for disentangled and interpretable embeddings, which drive our new objective functions, optimizing simultaneously for both interpretability and disentanglement. Additionally, we propose several new metrics to evaluate representation quality and human interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |
| **[Acquisition of interpretable domain information during brain MR image harmonization for content-based image retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14535v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images. PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image $\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,3 figures, 3 tables.

Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for exploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations. Accordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design principle of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation is unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks yields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification or decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We suggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may underlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by ensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into an abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other networks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal proximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small ``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the networks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network architectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising networks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that decoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of single networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal for small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is nearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We thus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as an algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective computation in the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced according to the capabilities of each modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some Insights in Balanced Multimodal Learning</p></details> |

We present BINCTX, a learning approach that builds multi-modal representations of an app from (i) a global bytecode-as-image view that captures code-level semantics and family-style patterns, (ii) a contextual view (manifested actions, components, declared permissions, URL/IP constants) indicating how behaviors are triggered, and (iii) a third-party-library usage view summarizing invocation frequencies along inter-component call paths. The three views are embedded and fused to train a contextual-aware classifier. On real-world malware and benign apps, BINCTX attains a macro F1 of 94.73%, outperforming strong baselines by at least 14.92%. It remains robust under commercial obfuscation (F1 84% post-obfuscation) and is more resistant to adversarial samples than state-of-the-art bytecode-only systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Safety, Alignment, and Ethics (AI SAE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24065v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper grounds ethics in evolutionary biology, viewing moral norms as adaptive mechanisms that render cooperation fitness-viable under selection pressure. Current alignment approaches add ethics post hoc, treating it as an external constraint rather than embedding it as an evolutionary strategy for cooperation. The central question is whether normative architectures can be embedded directly into AI systems to sustain human--AI cooperation (symbiosis) as capabilities scale. To address this, I propose a governance--embedding--representation pipeline linking moral representation learning to system-level design and institutional governance, treating alignment as a multi-level problem spanning cognition, optimization, and oversight. I formalize moral norm representation through the moral problem space, a learnable subspace in neural representations where cooperative norms can be encoded and causally manipulated. Using sparse autoencoders, activation steering, and causal interventions, I outline a research program for engineering moral representations and embedding them into the full semantic space -- treating competing theories of morality as empirical hypotheses about representation geometry rather than philosophical positions. Governance principles leverage these learned moral representations to regulate how cooperative behaviors evolve within the AI ecosystem. Through replicator dynamics and multi-agent game theory, I model how internal representational features can shape population-level incentives by motivating the design of sanctions and subsidies structured to yield decentralized normative institutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 9 figures (including appendix), 1 table</p></details> |

Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Frontiers in Bioinformatics</p></details> |

Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Self-Predictive Representations for Combinatorial Generalization in Behavioral Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10137v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally correlated states are properly encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. We formalize this notion by demonstrating how encouraging long-range temporal consistency via successor representations (SR) can facilitate generalization. We then propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ for GCBC, which theoretically approximates the successor representation in the finite MDP case through self-predictive representations, and achieves competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniME-V2: MLLM-as-a-Judge for Universal Multimodal Embedding Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13515v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency.

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, there has been little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges. This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph representations. We also show that different representations induce significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[TMT: Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation with Region-adaptive Transferability Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05774v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Shapes Koopman Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel multimodal Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion, Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1% explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12796v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g., the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple, simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Representations through Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05108v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

| **[LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</p></details> |  |

SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian generative decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19133v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Riemannian representation learning typically relies on an encoder to estimate densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing numerically brittle objectives, potentially harming model training and quality. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder, a unifying approach for finding manifold-valued latents on any Riemannian manifold. Latents are learned with a Riemannian optimizer while jointly training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

| **[A Hierarchical Quantized Tokenization Framework for Task-Adaptive Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12369v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in language and vision foundation models demonstrates the importance of discrete token interfaces that transform complex inputs into compact sequences for large-scale modeling. Extending this paradigm to graphs requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways, which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable computational budgets.</p></details> |  |

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 17 pages appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and resources are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMDGA-7289.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |

For sketch learning methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels: sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine (point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and 1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively, and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Representation Gaps Be the Key to Enhancing Robustness in Graph-Text Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12087v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pattern-based Knowledge Component Extraction from Student Code Using Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09281v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.</p></details> |  |
