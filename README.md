| **[Enriched text-guided variational multimodal knowledge distillation network (VMD) for automated diagnosis of plaque vulnerability in 3D carotid artery MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11924v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Robustness of Vision-Language Models Under Noisy Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12492v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniWorld: A Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset for 4D World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12201v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |
| **[Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight paper</p></details> |
| **[DMLDroid: Deep Multimodal Fusion Framework for Android Malware Detection with Resilience to Code Obfuscation and Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11187v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, learning-based Android malware detection has seen significant advancements, with detectors generally falling into three categories: string-based, image-based, and graph-based approaches. While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Filling the Gaps: A Multitask Hybrid Multiscale Generative Framework for Missing Modality in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11102v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

| **[Why Bonds Fail Differently? Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abn-BLIP: Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis and Report Generation from CTPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02034v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting.

| **[Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE, a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Online Learning by Integrating Biosensors and Multimodal Learning Analytics for Detecting and Predicting Student Behavior: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07742v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern online learning, understanding and predicting student behavior is crucial for enhancing engagement and optimizing educational outcomes. This systematic review explores the integration of biosensors and Multimodal Learning Analytics (MmLA) to analyze and predict student behavior during computer-based learning sessions. We examine key challenges, including emotion and attention detection, behavioral analysis, experimental design, and demographic considerations in data collection. Our study highlights the growing role of physiological signals, such as heart rate, brain activity, and eye-tracking, combined with traditional interaction data and self-reports to gain deeper insights into cognitive states and engagement levels. We synthesize findings from 54 key studies, analyzing commonly used methodologies such as advanced machine learning algorithms and multimodal data pre-processing techniques. The review identifies current research trends, limitations, and emerging directions in the field, emphasizing the transformative potential of biosensor-driven adaptive learning systems. Our findings suggest that integrating multimodal data can facilitate personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and intelligent educational interventions, ultimately advancing toward a more customized and adaptive online learning experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Behaviour & Information Technology (Taylor & Francis).

| **[MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08040v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19769v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.</p></details> | 13pages,7 figures |
| **[Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from each modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme. UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance improvement in multimodal learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection, formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IUI2026</p></details> |

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal learning of melt pool dynamics in laser powder bed fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03029v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has broad applicability in additive manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Resilient Multimodal Industrial Surface Defect Detection with Uncertain Sensors Availability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02962v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

| **[OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at: https://github.com/peng-lab/hescape</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities. Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose ConfSMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture by taking the opinion of experts and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, ConfSMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth signal. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. The proposed method is evaluated on four different real world dataset with three distinct experiment settings to conduct comprehensive analysis of ConfSMoE on resistance to missing modality and the impacts of proposed gating mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Multi-modal Learning of Histology and Transcriptomics for Cancer Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16479v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However, existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics. Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings.

| **[A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal representations, especially when these representations are obtained through explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities. To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[MMiC: Mitigating Modality Incompleteness in Clustered Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06911v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Analysis of Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14926v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</p></details> | 34 pages |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

| **[SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture. Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14784v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

While effective in bi-modal setups, these approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER, a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned embedding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, current multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention (MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection, but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1) \emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a \emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains \(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components, positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for multimodal product classification.</p></details> |  |

The usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior. In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation, classification, and regression tasks.

While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values.

Despite advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data. TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities, including video classification, image classification, and audio classification. The code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/TaAM-CPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers, enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently, state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications. To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |

Parallel to this progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency, robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance, their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning.

| **[T2UE: Generating Unlearnable Examples from Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03091v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level. The extensive experiments demonstrate that Kestrel effectively bridges the gap between part-aware language understanding and 3D segmentation grounding, paving the way for more robust and interpretable 3D object comprehension that meets the demands of real-world robotic applications.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |

The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning} has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only \emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also \emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |

This is because the performance of large multimodal models is positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error, significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's "Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries. Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved significantly better performance compared to similar works across various evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[One-stage Modality Distillation for Incomplete Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08204v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning based on multimodal data has attracted increasing interest recently. While a variety of sensory modalities can be collected for training, not all of them are always available in development scenarios, which raises the challenge to infer with incomplete modality. To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly. Extensive experiments on RGB-D classification and segmentation tasks demonstrate the proposed multimodal inheritance framework can overcome the problem of incomplete modality input in various scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder scalability and flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-video, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TransPrune: Token Transition Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20630v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens, motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method. Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention, achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL.

While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable, multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.</p></details> |  |

TD-Interpreter is a visual question-answer environment which allows engineers to input a set of TDs and ask design and verification queries regarding these TDs. We implemented TD-Interpreter with multimodal learning by fine-tuning LLaVA, a lightweight 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). To address limited training data availability, we developed a synthetic data generation workflow that aligns visual information with its textual interpretation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of TD-Interpreter which outperformed untuned GPT-4o by a large margin on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMID-Net: An Exploration of Masked Image Modeling and Knowledge Distillation in Hyperbolic Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09487v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified the abstract and reformatted it using latex</p></details> |

These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/MultiCrystalSpectrumSet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on DataWorld</p></details> |
| **[MaskHOI: Robust 3D Hand-Object Interaction Estimation via Masked Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13673v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI, a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[City-VLM: Towards Multidomain Perception Scene Understanding via Multimodal Incomplete Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12795v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation). Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

However, most current methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks: canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping. The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low-data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong performances near or better than the state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

Haptic-Informed ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-Informed ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments.

| **[Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.</p></details> | acm multimedia 2025 |
| **[A Robust Incomplete Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation Approach for Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11202v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Sentiment Analysis on CMU-MOSEI Dataset using Transformer-based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06110v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text, audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Boosting Multimodal Learning via Disentangled Gradient Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10213v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and is currently under review</p></details> |

While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent challenges and future directions.

However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAIP 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.08716</p></details> |

Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions.

Where Do We Stand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10966v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of brain infarction (i.e., irreversibly damaged tissue) is critical for guiding treatment decisions in acute ischemic stroke. Reliable infarct prediction informs key clinical interventions, including the need for patient transfer to comprehensive stroke centers, the potential benefit of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, decisions regarding secondary neuroprotective treatments, and ultimately, prognosis of clinical outcomes. This work introduces the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2024 challenge, which focuses on the prediction of final infarct volumes from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES24 provides a comprehensive, multimodal setting where participants can leverage all clinically and practically available data, including full acute CT imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and structured clinical information, across a train set of 150 cases. On the hidden test set of 98 cases, the top-performing model, a multimodal nnU-Net-based architecture, achieved a Dice score of 0.285 (+/- 0.213) and an absolute volume difference of 21.2 (+/- 37.2) mL, underlining the significant challenges posed by this task and the need for further advances in multimodal learning. This work makes two primary contributions: first, we establish a standardized, clinically realistic benchmark for post-treatment infarct prediction, enabling systematic evaluation of multimodal algorithmic strategies on a longitudinal stroke dataset; second, we analyze current methodological limitations and outline key research directions to guide the development of next-generation infarct prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.

These challenges become more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address these issues, we propose SEAL, a vision-language model-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAL significantly outperforms existing baselines in reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the safety, robustness, and scalability of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Our standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology, that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology (SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes. Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gated Recursive Fusion: A Stateful Approach to Scalable Multimodal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02985v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Harnessing Shared Relations via Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17777v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This request is based on the fact that one of the co-authors is a PhD student whose advisor has informed her that she was not authorized to publicly release this work without his prior approval.

However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Test-Time Consistency in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22395v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency. Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Citizen science platforms provide large annotated datasets from focal recordings, where the target species is intentionally recorded. However, PAM requires monitoring in passive soundscapes, creating a domain shift between focal and passive recordings, challenging deep learning models trained on focal recordings. To address domain generalization, we leverage supervised contrastive learning by enforcing domain invariance across same-class examples from different domains. Additionally, we propose ProtoCLR, an alternative to SupCon loss which reduces the computational complexity by comparing examples to class prototypes instead of pairwise comparisons. We conduct few-shot classification based on BIRB, a large-scale bird sound benchmark to assess pre-trained bioacoustic models. Our findings suggest that ProtoCLR is a better alternative to SupCon.</p></details> |  |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13229v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v5)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Robust Sim-to-Real Transfer of Adaptive Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12858v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment: policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this ``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg} slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method.

While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance, particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Federated Cross-Training Learners for Robust Generalization under Data Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20046v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning benefits from cross-training strategies, which enables models to train on data from distinct sources to improve generalization capability. However, due to inherent differences in data distributions, the optimization goals of local models remain misaligned, and this mismatch continues to manifest as feature space heterogeneity even after cross-training. We argue that knowledge distillation from the personalized view preserves client-specific characteristics and expands the local knowledge base, while distillation from the global view provides consistent semantic anchors that facilitate feature alignment across clients. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a cross-training scheme, termed FedCT, includes three main modules, where the consistency-aware knowledge broadcasting module aims to optimize model assignment strategies, which enhances collaborative advantages between clients and achieves an efficient federated learning process. The multi-view knowledge-guided representation learning module leverages fused prototypical knowledge from both global and local views to enhance the preservation of local knowledge before and after model exchange, as well as to ensure consistency between local and global knowledge. The mixup-based feature augmentation module aggregates rich information to further increase the diversity of feature spaces, which enables the model to better discriminate complex samples. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets in terms of performance comparison, ablation study, in-depth analysis and case study. The results demonstrated that FedCT alleviates knowledge forgetting from both local and global views, which enables it outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the emerging Selective State Space Model (Mamba) with nearly linear computational complexity and efficient long-term modeling, we present a novel HSI denoising network named HSIDMamba (HSDM). HSDM is tailored to exploit the capture of potential spatial-spectral dependencies effectively and efficiently for HSI denoising. In particular, HSDM comprises multiple Hyperspectral Continuous Scan Blocks (HCSB) to strengthen spatial-spectral interactions. HCSB links forward and backward scans and enhances information from eight directions through the State Space Model (SSM), strengthening the context representation learning of HSDM and improving denoising performance more effectively. In addition, to enhance the utilization of spectral information and mitigate the degradation problem caused by long-range scanning, spectral attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations against HSI denoising benchmarks validate the superior performance of HSDM, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing the efficiency of the transformer method SERT by 31%.</p></details> |  |

First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss. In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is deployed in.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAM++: Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12039v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++), a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at https://github.com/DragonisCV/RAM</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 CDEL Workshop</p></details> |

Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  |

This supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data.

However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Network Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11316v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network representation learning seeks to embed networks into a low-dimensional space while preserving the structural and semantic properties, thereby facilitating downstream tasks such as classification, trait prediction, edge identification, and community detection. Motivated by challenges in brain connectivity data analysis that is characterized by subject-specific, high-dimensional, and sparse networks that lack node or edge covariates, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based statistical approach for network edge embedding, which we name as Adaptive Contrastive Edge Representation Learning (ACERL). It builds on two key components: contrastive learning of augmented network pairs, and a data-driven adaptive random masking mechanism. We establish the non-asymptotic error bounds, and show that our method achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate for edge representation learning. We further demonstrate the applicability of the learned representation in multiple downstream tasks, including network classification, important edge detection, and community detection, and establish the corresponding theoretical guarantees. We validate our method through both synthetic data and real brain connectivities studies, and show its competitive performance compared to the baseline method of sparse principal components analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pretrained Molecular Embedding Models For Molecular Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06199v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARK: Adaptive Low-Rank Knowledge Graph Modeling in Hybrid Geometric Spaces for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11094v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommender systems but face challenges from inherent noise, sparsity, and Euclidean geometry's inadequacy for complex relational structures, critically impairing representation learning, especially for long-tail entities. Existing methods also often lack adaptive multi-source signal fusion tailored to item popularity. This paper introduces SPARK, a novel multi-stage framework systematically tackling these issues. SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SPARK.</p></details> | Accepted by CIKM' 25 |

Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 -- across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong generalization to unknown intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

This dissertation employs computational social science techniques to investigate these issues, understand the social dynamics driving negative online behaviors, and propose data-driven solutions for healthier digital interactions. I begin by introducing a scalable social network representation learning method that integrates user-generated content with social connections to create unified user embeddings, enabling accurate prediction and visualization of user attributes, communities, and behavioral propensities. Using this tool, I explore three interrelated problems: 1) COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, revealing polarization and asymmetric political echo chambers; 2) online hate speech, suggesting the pursuit of social approval motivates toxic behavior; and 3) moral underpinnings of COVID-19 discussions, uncovering patterns of moral homophily and echo chambers, while also indicating moral diversity and plurality can improve message reach and acceptance across ideological divides. These findings contribute to the advancement of computational social science and provide a foundation for understanding human behavior through the lens of social interactions and network homophily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California, 2024</p></details> |

By combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture structural dependencies among confounders with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for latent representation learning, our method expands the sample space and performs clustering that integrates even outlier sets into coherent subgroups. Clusterwise causal effects are then estimated using a doubly robust outlier-resistant estimator, yielding stable and generalizable results. Simulations and real-world applications confirm superior performance compared with existing HTE methods, highlighting the framework's potential for precision medicine and policy evaluation.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep reinforcement learning-based path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

This paper demonstrates the practical application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context. Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes. Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks, emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However, consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG, an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning, which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 4 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</p></details> |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |

Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

| **[Why and How Auxiliary Tasks Improve JEPA Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12249v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately. Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRAE: Vertical Residual Autoencoder for License Plate Denoising and Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08392v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in https://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL. Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the model.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Intuitively, a representation is said to be disentangled if it separates the different factors of variation in a way that is understandable to humans. Definitions of disentanglement and metrics to measure it usually assume that the factors of variation are independent of each other. However, this is generally false in the real world, which limits the use of these definitions and metrics to very specific and unrealistic scenarios. In this paper we give a definition of disentanglement based on information theory that is also valid when the factors of variation are not independent. Furthermore, we relate this definition to the Information Bottleneck Method. Finally, we propose a method to measure the degree of disentanglement from the given definition that works when the factors of variation are not independent. We show through different experiments that the method proposed in this paper correctly measures disentanglement with non-independent factors of variation, while other methods fail in this scenario.</p></details> |  |

This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning.

Learned features demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA (SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning, which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 27,927x speedup versus a traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements when training on MD simulations.

Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

However, most methods focus solely on the spatial distribution features of point clouds while overlooking the relationship between local information and the whole structure, which limits the accuracy of point cloud representation. Local information reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric features. Therefore, the appropriate introduction of physics-driven mechanism can effectively compensate for the limitations of data-driven methods in structural modeling and significantly enhance the generalization and interpretability of point cloud representations in downstream tasks such as understanding and recognition. Inspired by this, we incorporate a physics-driven mechanism into the data-driven method to learn fine-grained features in point clouds and model the structural relationship between local regions and the whole shape. Specifically, we design a dual-task encoder-decoder framework that combines the geometric modeling capability of data-driven implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. Through the integration of physics-based loss functions, the framework is guided to predict localized deformation and explicitly capture the correspondence between local structural changes and whole shape variations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in object classification and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

| **[PEHRT: A Common Pipeline for Harmonizing Electronic Health Record data for Translational Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08553v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrative analysis of multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data enhances the reliability and generalizability of translational research by leveraging larger, more diverse patient cohorts and incorporating multiple data modalities. However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chirality in Action: Time-Aware Video Representation Learning by Latent Straightening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08502v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Joint Learning using Mixture-of-Expert-Based Representation for Enhanced Speech Generation and Robust Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08470v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bitrate-Controlled Diffusion for Disentangling Motion and Content in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08376v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader field of video analysis and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimCroP: Radiograph Representation Learning with Similarity-driven Cross-granularity Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08311v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-, and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PriorCLIP: Visual Prior Guided Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10160v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image-text retrieval plays a crucial role in remote sensing interpretation, yet remains challenging under both closed-domain and open-domain scenarios due to semantic noise and domain shifts. To address these issues, we propose a visual prior-guided vision-language model, PriorCLIP, which leverages visual priors for unbiased representation learning and adaptive vision-language alignment. In the closed-domain setting, PriorCLIP introduces two Progressive Attention Encoder (PAE) structures: Spatial-PAE constructs a belief matrix with instruction embeddings to filter key features and mitigate semantic bias. At the same time, Temporal-PAE exploits cyclic activation across time steps to enhance text representation. For the open-domain setting, we design a two-stage prior representation learning strategy, consisting of large-scale pre-training on coarse-grained image-text pairs, followed by fine-tuning on fine-grained pairs using vision-instruction, which enables robust retrieval across long-tail concepts and vocabulary shifts. Furthermore, a cluster-based symmetric contrastive Attribution Loss is proposed to constrain inter-class relations and alleviate semantic confusion in the shared embedding space. Extensive experiments on RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that PriorCLIP achieves substantial improvements, outperforming existing methods by 4.9% and 4.0% in closed-domain retrieval, and by 7.3% and 9.4% in open-domain retrieval, respectively.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Domain Knowledge is Power: Leveraging Physiological Priors for Self Supervised Representation Learning in Electrocardiography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08116v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations. Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia, for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts, PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline, underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance: PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e., they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability. This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences, implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability. Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of existing unlearnable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06570v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops</p></details> |
| **[RealRep: Generalized SDR-to-HDR Conversion via Attribute-Disentangled Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07322v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Dynamic-Range Wide-Color-Gamut (HDR-WCG) technology is becoming increasingly widespread, driving a growing need for converting Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content to HDR. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone mapping operators, which struggle to handle the diverse appearances and degradations commonly present in real-world SDR content. To address this limitation, we propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR framework that enhances robustness by learning attribute-disentangled representations. Central to our approach is Realistic Attribute-Disentangled Representation Learning (RealRep), which explicitly disentangles luminance and chrominance components to capture intrinsic content variations across different SDR distributions. Furthermore, we design a Luma-/Chroma-aware negative exemplar generation strategy that constructs degradation-sensitive contrastive pairs, effectively modeling tone discrepancies across SDR styles. Building on these attribute-level priors, we introduce the Degradation-Domain Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a lightweight, two-stage framework that performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via degradation-conditioned features, enabling robust adaptation across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealRep consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%, BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image segmentation.

To address these problems, we propose a new method that unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW. Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks and fields, compared to prior models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |

Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance, invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear feature learning without explicit mappings. We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data. Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with modern representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fed-REACT: Federated Representation Learning for Heterogeneous and Evolving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07198v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments, client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data. Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Due to its challenges, diversity of semantic descriptions, and practical value in various applications, it has become a common downstream task for evaluating the performance of general-purpose music representations learned from audio data. We introduce a new benchmarking dataset based on the recently published MGPHot dataset, which includes expert musicological annotations, allowing for additional insights and comparisons with results obtained on common generic tag datasets. While MGPHot annotations have been shown to be useful for computational musicology, the original dataset neither includes audio nor provides evaluation setups for its use as a standardized autotagging benchmark. To address this, we provide a curated set of YouTube URLs with retrievable audio, and propose a train/val/test split for standardized evaluation, and precomputed representations for seven state-of-the-art models. Using these resources, we evaluated these models in MGPHot and standard reference tag datasets, highlighting key differences between expert and generic tag annotations. Altogether, our contributions provide a more advanced benchmarking framework for future research in music understanding.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches such as contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders address this challenge with varying trade-offs. In this paper, we introduce the {contrastive Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that augments the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a novel contrastive objective. While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latent variables and encourages clustering of latent codes, its representations underperform on discriminative tasks compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. cMIM addresses this limitation by enforcing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative strengths. We present two main contributions: (1) we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that eliminates the need for positive data augmentation and is robust to batch size, unlike InfoNCE-based methods; (2) we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for extracting enriched representations from encoder--decoder models that substantially improve discriminative performance without additional training, and which apply broadly beyond MIM. Empirical results demonstrate that cMIM consistently outperforms MIM and InfoNCE in classification and regression tasks, while preserving comparable reconstruction quality. These findings suggest that cMIM provides a unified framework for learning representations that are simultaneously effective for discriminative and generative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A wor...</summary><p>A working draft.

Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability.

This work addresses the critical bottleneck hindering AI's progression toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)--the disconnect between language models and "world models"--as well as the fundamental limitations of Transformer-based architectures rooted in the conventional representation learning paradigm. BriLLM incorporates two pivotal neurocognitive principles: (1) static semantic mapping, where tokens are mapped to specialized nodes analogous to cortical areas, and (2) dynamic signal propagation, which simulates electrophysiological information dynamics observed in brain activity. This architecture enables multiple transformative breakthroughs: natural multi-modal compatibility, full model interpretability at the node level, context-length independent scaling, and the first global-scale simulation of brain-like information processing for language tasks. Our initial 1-2B parameter models successfully replicate GPT-1-level generative capabilities while demonstrating stable perplexity reduction. Scalability analyses confirm the feasibility of 100-200B parameter variants capable of processing 40,000-token vocabularies. The paradigm is reinforced by both Occam's Razor--evidenced in the simplicity of direct semantic mapping--and natural evolution--given the brain's empirically validated AGI architecture. BriLLM establishes a novel, biologically grounded framework for AGI advancement that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</p></details> |  |

An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets, open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are interested in asking: What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the learning process? To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of various types of unusual atypical data (e.g., sci-fi, animation, etc.). To study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset, encouraging further studies in this direction.

While large language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically, Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP Findings 2025</p></details> |

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05341v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06306v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However, relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenAI-Powered Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03897v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models -- such as large language models and diffusion models -- not only to generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional representations that are guaranteed to capture their underlying structure. Applying machine learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2) estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06015v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions. Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation. Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image. The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11% over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively.

| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v4)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer with Spherical Harmonic Posterior Sampling for High-Fidelity Angular Super-Resolution in Diffusion MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07020v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR) data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and clinical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903v4)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transit for All: Mapping Equitable Bike2Subway Connection using Region Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15113v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.</p></details> | SIGSPATIAL 25 |

This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build ShapeSplat, a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet, ModelNet and Objaverse datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 206K objects spanning over 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 3.8 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU. We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as 3DV'25 Oral, project page: https://unique1i.github.io/ShapeSplat_webpage/</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05757v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding, text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area. Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures, hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs (HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4) hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications and outline future research directions.

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

While most self-supervised representation learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous representation learning works that are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting representations of the same action class across different permutations, while ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 accepted paper</p></details> |

While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[SL-SLR: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05188v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.</p></details> |  |

While existing embedding methods effectively preserve local similarity measures, they often fail to capture global functions like graph distances. Inspired by Bourgain's seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings of metric spaces (1985), we study the performance of local distance-preserving node embeddings. Known as landmark-based algorithms, these embeddings approximate pairwise distances by computing shortest paths from a small subset of reference nodes called landmarks. Our main theoretical contribution shows that random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs, require lower dimensions in landmark-based embeddings compared to worst-case graphs. Empirically, we demonstrate that the GNN-based approximations for the distances to landmarks generalize well to larger real-world networks, offering a scalable and transferable alternative for graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Landm...</summary><p>Landmark-based embeddings preserve global distances in graphs more efficiently; on Erdos-Renyi random graphs they need lower dimensions, and GNNs generalize these embeddings to large real-world networks</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multidimensional Urban Poverty Representation with Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04958v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the inference of urban socioeconomic characteristics from satellite imagery. However, models relying solely on urbanization traits often show weak correlations with poverty indicators, as unplanned urban growth can obscure economic disparities and spatial inequalities. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel representation learning framework that captures multidimensional deprivation-related traits from very high-resolution satellite imagery for precise urban poverty mapping. Our approach integrates three complementary traits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode proximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from building footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and (3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic activity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from non-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we incorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits during training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features into a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of poverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations across three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for poverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach. Code and model are available at https://github.com/shunyuzh/MSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting actions to human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions. This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks. Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at CoRL2025</p></details> |

However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Representation Learning for Multi-Intent Diversity and Behavioral Uncertainty in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04694v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in real-world recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

Our upstream models are trained on extensive data sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks, including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems, resulting in significant gains in online metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.</p></details> |  |

However, current general-purpose music representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music, expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music, achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2025)</p></details> |

However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA25)</p></details> |

Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, ACM Multimedia 2025 Dataset Track</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |

Our work is motivated by the limitations of current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, which predominantly focus on content explanations that elucidate the linguistic features and sentence structures of the misinformation. To address this limitation, we explore various explanations beyond content explanation, such as "social explanation" that considers the broader social context surrounding misinformation, as well as a "combined explanation" where both the content and social explanations are presented in scenarios that are either aligned or misaligned with each other. To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these AI explanations, we conduct two online crowdsourcing experiments in the COVID-19 (Study 1 on Prolific) and Politics domains (Study 2 on MTurk). Our results show that AI explanations are generally effective in aiding users to detect misinformation, with effectiveness significantly influenced by the alignment between content and social explanations. We also find that the order in which explanation types are presented - specifically, whether a content or social explanation comes first - can influence detection accuracy, with differences found between the COVID-19 and Political domains. This work contributes towards more effective design of AI explanations, fostering a deeper understanding of how different explanation types and their combinations influence misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model.

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.</p></details> |  |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-CaTCH: Event-Centric Cross-Modal Attention with Temporal Consistency and Class-Imbalance Handling for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11197v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii) factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to 5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale quality across all three dimensions.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links, and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels. However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER, we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025. 11 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Toward Verifiable Misinformation Detection: A Multi-Tool LLM Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03092v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory Network for Multi-modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02479v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection. The code and data have been released.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated code and dataset, see https://github.com/neu-vi/XFacta</p></details> |

To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection.

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have focused on developing datasets and methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic examples that lack real-world complexity, limiting model robustness. Meanwhile, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underexplored for generating diverse and realistic synthetic data for MMD. To address, we introduce "Miscaption This!", a collection of LVLM-generated miscaptioned image datasets. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better to real-world misinformation while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the value of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD. Our code is available at https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Lacking robust automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation generation to low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.</p></details> |  |

This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information.

To control their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative, inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second, the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures.

Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain. This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and other low-moderation social platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, only a few studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR). The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.</p></details> |  |

Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion.

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Truth over Tricks: Measuring and Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02350v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e., \emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation. This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Large Language Models for Misinformation Detection in Low-Resource Linguistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01587v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection.

| **[Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Stance Detection: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08464v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |
| **[CAMOUFLAGE: Exploiting Misinformation Detection Systems Through LLM-driven Adversarial Claim Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01900v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |

While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GenAI vs. Human Fact-Checkers: Accurate Ratings, Flawed Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14943v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |

We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators.

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpMis: An Investigation of Synthetic Spoken Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11308v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, speech generation technology has advanced rapidly, fueled by generative models and large-scale training techniques. While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Logic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05964v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation on online social platforms is becoming a critical concern due to increasing credibility and easier dissemination brought by multimedia content, compared to traditional text-only information. While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

| **[Exploring the Role of Audio in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12558v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of deepfake technology, especially the deep audio fake technology, misinformation detection on the social media scene meets a great challenge. Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning. We make our code and data publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Code available at https://github.com/UKPLab/5pils</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PACIS 2024. 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[ConspEmoLLM: Conspiracy Theory Detection Using an Emotion-Based Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06765v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19192v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14321v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for misinformation detection and fact checking. Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Similarity over Factuality: Are we making progress on multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13488v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/LLMs-Macronutrient-Estimation-NHANES-Adolescents</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World Interview Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13244v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents, counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Traditional LLM applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases. Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments) without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale "silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard" dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems.

| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13154v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering LLMs with Parameterized Skills for Adversarial Long-Horizon Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13127v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions, and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI. Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6 closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Discovery: Rapid Literature Screening with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13103v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version of the manuscript has been submitted to Empirical Software Engieering Journal for consideration</p></details> |
| **[Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21740v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.</p></details> |  |

Equipment languages such as the Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater productivity in semiconductor software development.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Main 2025</p></details> |

At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12067v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. We release our code and checkpoints in https://github.com/hemingkx/TokenSkip.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Long Paper), camera-ready version</p></details> |

Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior. We release our code at https://github.com/faridlazuarda/from-surveys-to-narratives.</p></details> |  |

On Multilingual Estimation of LLM Hallucination in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12769v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the age of misinformation, hallucination -- the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate non-factual or unfaithful responses -- represents the main risk for their global utility. Despite LLMs becoming increasingly multilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM hallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT) and summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open information seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM hallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question answering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model and conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM families. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on MT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually annotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for these languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between silver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data for estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates estimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with LLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while LLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates of languages and their digital representation. Further, we find that smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination rates than larger models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

A Benchmark for Cultural Adaptations of Wine Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12961v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness -- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures. This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in handling cultural content.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |

Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese MTEB (May 19, 2025).</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Oral |

Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling, auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state, without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency, Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer generated tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v5)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra.

However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.</p></details> |  |

We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1) updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.</p></details> |  |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks.

Investigating Human and Multimodal LLM Image Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12750v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together, these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables; appendix 16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12743v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow, while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably, GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-stakes texts such as patent claims, medical records, and technical reports are structurally complex and demand a high degree of reliability and precision. While large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to automate their generation in high-stakes domains, reliably evaluating such outputs remains a major challenge. Conventional natural language generation (NLG) metrics are effective for generic documents but fail to capture the structural and legal characteristics essential to evaluating complex high-stakes documents. To address this gap, we propose PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework specifically designed for one of the most intricate and rigorous domains, patent claims. PatentScore integrates hierarchical decomposition of claim elements, validation patterns grounded in legal and technical standards, and scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. In experiments on our dataset which consists of 400 Claim1, PatentScore achieved the highest correlation with expert annotations ($r = 0.819$), significantly outperforming widely used NLG metrics. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating LLM-generated patent claims, providing a solid foundation for research on patent generation and validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Aware GPU Resource Allocation for Distributed LLM Inference via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10259v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) services imposes increasing demands on distributed GPU inference infrastructure. Most existing scheduling systems follow a reactive paradigm, relying solely on the current system state to make decisions, without considering how task demand and resource availability evolve over time. This lack of temporal awareness in reactive approaches leads to inefficient GPU utilization, high task migration overhead, and poor system responsiveness under dynamic workloads. In this work, we identify the fundamental limitations of these instantaneous-state-only scheduling approaches and propose Temporal Optimal Resource scheduling via Two-layer Architecture (TORTA). TORTA introduces a spatiotemporal scheduling framework that captures both long-term workload patterns and short-term execution constraints. It adopts a two-layer design: a macro-level scheduler leverages reinforcement learning and optimal transport to coordinate inter-region task distribution, while a micro-level allocator refines task-to-server assignments within each region to reduce latency and switching costs. Experimental results across multiple network topologies show that TORTA reduces average inference response time by up to 15\%, improves load balance by approximately 4-5\%, and cuts total operational cost by 10-20\% compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |
| **[IMPROVE: Iterative Model Pipeline Refinement and Optimization Leveraging LLM Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18530v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-level Randomization: Toward More Stable LLM Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12678v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Conventional content moderation classifiers, which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups. We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits. Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training. We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.</p></details> |  |

However, their frequent generation of insecure code presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover, prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502 attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness. This study provides essential insights and practical guidance for building more resilient software systems with LLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Yet most work evaluates only classification metrics, leaving unclear whether sentiment signals align with market behavior. We propose FinSentLLM, a lightweight multi-LLM framework that integrates an expert panel of sentiment forecasting LLMs, and structured semantic financial signals via a compact meta-classifier. This design captures expert complementarity, semantic reasoning signal, and agreement/divergence patterns without costly retraining, yielding consistent 3-6% gains over strong baselines in accuracy and F1-score on the Financial PhraseBank dataset. In addition, we also provide econometric evidence that financial sentiment and stock markets exhibit statistically significant long-run comovement, applying Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) and the Johansen cointegration test to daily sentiment scores computed from the FNSPID dataset and major stock indices. Together, these results demonstrate that FinSentLLM delivers superior forecasting accuracy for financial sentiment and further establish that sentiment signals are robustly linked to long-run equity market dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.

| **[ECG-aBcDe: Overcoming Model Dependence, Encoding ECG into a Universal Language for Any LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12625v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere" capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of 42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of the new paradigm.</p></details> | 14pages, 6 figures |

Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summarization and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions. All the related resources of LLM-based, including research papers, benchmarks, and open-source projects, are collected for the community in our repository: https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-LLM-based-Text2SQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.</p></details> | Preprint |

As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics, including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the documents they use as their information sources. In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether these arguments are the same for different LLMs. In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance, highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

We first conducted a need-finding study with 6 novices and 3 experts to understand how they utilize LLMs in DP implementation. While DP experts can implement correct DP analyses through a few prompts, novices struggle to articulate their requirements in prompts and lack the skills to verify the correctness of the generated code. We then developed DPCheatSheet, an instructional tool that helps novices implement DP using LLMs. DPCheatSheet combines two learning concepts: it annotates an expert's workflow with LLMs as a worked example to bridge the expert mindset to novices, and it presents five common mistakes in LLM-based DP code generation as erroneous examples to support error-driven learning. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DPCheatSheet with an error identification study and an open-ended DP implementation study.</p></details> |  |

However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15474</p></details> |

To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents, equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the effectiveness and value of our framework.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

While historically effective, prior methods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications (SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages, undermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks the behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that users exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing traffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral entropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust performance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop session-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a scalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents. These multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to simulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than human collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from 20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance across human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under 10\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In contrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\% range, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate that for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data quality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is essential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior.</p></details> |  |

Current detection methods often resort to external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or supervised training with large hallucination-labeled datasets. Moreover, these approaches do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which is crucial for enhancing detection performance. To address such limitations, we introduce hallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery that perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three types of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing method that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM fine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern LLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection, outperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs, underscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

However, such approaches struggle to capture grounded user intents and to handle sparsity and cold-start scenarios. In this work, we present LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that constructs an intent-centric knowledge graph where both users and items are explicitly linked to intent nodes extracted by a tuning-free, RAG-guided LLM pipeline. By grounding intents in external knowledge sources and user profiles, IKGR canonically represents what a user seeks and what an item satisfies as first-class entities. To alleviate sparsity, we further introduce a mutual-intent connectivity densification strategy, which shortens semantic paths between users and long-tail items without requiring cross-graph fusion. Finally, a lightweight GNN layer is employed on top of the intent-enhanced graph to produce recommendation signals with low latency. Extensive experiments on public and enterprise datasets demonstrate that IKGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly on cold-start and long-tail slices, while remaining efficient through a fully offline LLM pipeline.</p></details> |  |

However, empirical evidence remains limited on whether they meaningfully shift user attention toward belief-challenging content, promote belief change, or outperform traditional debiasing strategies. To investigate this, we compare an LLM-based multi-persona debate system with a two-stance retrieval-based system, exposing participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial topics. By collecting eye-tracking data, belief change measures, and qualitative feedback, our results show that while the debate system does not significantly increase attention to opposing views, or make participants shift away from prior beliefs, it does provide a buffering effect against bias caused by individual cognitive tendency. These findings shed light on both the promise and limits of multi-persona debate systems in information seeking, and we offer design insights to guide future work toward more balanced and reflective information engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Complete reanalysis using a revised methodology; results, figures, and discussion updated to reflect the new approach</p></details> |
| **[Polysemantic Dropout: Conformal OOD Detection for Specialized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04655v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Consequently, the potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector, SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in the out-of-domain setting.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |

Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high. We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system comparisons. Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically principled, evaluation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EARL 25: The 2nd Workshop on Evaluating and Applying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models at RecSys 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |

Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.</p></details> |  |

While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Random Rule Forest (RRF), a lightweight ensemble method that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate simple YES/NO questions in natural language. Each question functions as a weak learner, and their responses are combined using a threshold-based voting rule to form a strong, interpretable predictor. Applied to a dataset of 9,892 founders, RRF achieves a 6.9x improvement over a random baseline on held-out data; adding expert-crafted questions lifts this to 8x and highlights the value of human-LLM collaboration. Compared with zero- and few-shot baselines across three LLM architectures, RRF attains an F0.5 of 0.121, versus 0.086 for the best baseline (+0.035 absolute, +41% relative). By combining the creativity of LLMs with the rigor of ensemble learning, RRF delivers interpretable, high-precision predictions suitable for decision-making in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including appendix, 4 figures</p></details> |

LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12190v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench</p></details> |

While prior work has demonstrated these risks, little is known about how users estimate and respond. We conducted a survey with 240 U.S. participants who judged text snippets for inference risks, reported concern levels, and attempted rewrites to block inference. We compared their rewrites with those generated by ChatGPT and Rescriber, a state-of-the-art sanitization tool. Results show that participants struggled to anticipate inference, performing a little better than chance. User rewrites were effective in just 28\% of cases - better than Rescriber but worse than ChatGPT. We examined our participants' rewriting strategies, and observed that while paraphrasing was the most common strategy it is also the least effective; instead abstraction and adding ambiguity were more successful. Our work highlights the importance of inference-aware design in LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuantAgent: Price-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for High-Frequency Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09995v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming random prediction baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</p></details> |  |

Yet such intents are often underspecified and evolve during interaction, dynamic support for intent communication is essential. Through a systematic literature review of 33 papers, we synthesize a structured understanding of intent communication, identifying four key aspects: articulation, exploration, management, and synchronization. Building on these findings, we derived design implications that translate them into actionable design and implemented IntentFlow, a system for LLM-based writing that realizes these implications through adjustable UIs, intent-to-output linking, and versioned refinement. A technical evaluation (N=60) and a within-subjects study (N=12) confirm that IntentFlow helps users discover, elaborate, and consolidate their intents into a curated set. Interaction logs further reveal a shift from reactive error correction to proactive intent refinement. Our work demonstrates how a system effectively designed to support these four communication aspects can substantially enhance human-LLM interaction.</p></details> |  |

Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages. In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations. Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem. UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE HPEC conference 2025. 9 pages, incl references</p></details> |

Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls. Codes for this work are available at https://github.com/Hanpx20/SafeSwitch.</p></details> |  |

Studying instructors' usage is critical, given their role in teaching and guiding AI adoption in education. We designed and evaluated TeaPT, an LLM for pedagogical purposes that supports instructors' professional development through two conversational approaches: a Socratic approach that uses guided questioning to foster reflection, and a Narrative approach that offers elaborated suggestions to extend externalized cognition. In a mixed-method study with 41 higher-education instructors, the Socratic version elicited greater engagement, while the Narrative version was preferred for actionable guidance. Subgroup analyses further revealed that less-experienced, AI-optimistic instructors favored the Socratic version, whereas more-experienced, AI-cautious instructors preferred the Narrative version. We contribute design implications for LLMs for pedagogical purposes, showing how adaptive conversational approaches can support instructors with varied profiles while highlighting how AI attitudes and experience shape interaction and learning.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments, enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods. Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools. JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at CIKM 2025 (Demo Track)</p></details> |

We present a study comparing therapist-written responses to those generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama for real patient questions. Text analysis showed that LLMs produced longer, more readable, and lexically richer responses with a more positive tone, while therapist responses were more often written in the first person. In a survey with 150 users and 23 licensed therapists, participants rated LLM responses as clearer, more respectful, and more supportive than therapist-written answers. Yet, both groups of participants expressed a stronger preference for human therapist support. These findings highlight the promise and limitations of LLMs in mental health, underscoring the need for designs that balance their communicative strengths with concerns of trust, privacy, and accountability.</p></details> |  |

Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |

While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Computer Architecture Letter</p></details> |

Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[NeuroStrike: Neuron-Level Attacks on Aligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11864v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment is critical for the ethical deployment of large language models (LLMs), guiding them to avoid generating harmful or unethical content. Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic linguistic conditions.

A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337v5)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 tables, 1 figure, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on NLP & AI for Cyber Security</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025, Main Conference</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback, allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong practical utility and effective performance.</p></details> |  |

Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques, including graph attention and initial residual connection. The comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node classification and link prediction, outperforming existing LLM-based baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at EMNLP 2025 Findings.

| **[Navigating the Labyrinth: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Reason About Search Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12172v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance in math and reasoning benchmarks. However, they often struggle with logic problems and puzzles that are relatively easy for humans. To further investigate this, we introduce a new benchmark, SearchBench, which contains 11 unique search problems inspired by intuitive puzzles. Each SearchBench problem type is equipped with automated pipelines to generate an arbitrary number of instances and analyze the feasibility, correctness, and optimality of LLM-generated solutions. We show that using step-by-step, language-only reasoning, even the most advanced LLMs fail to solve SearchBench; for example, OpenAI's frontier models GPT-4 and o1-preview solve only 1.4% and 18.6% of problems, respectively. The reason is that SearchBench problems require considering multiple pathways and performing backtracking, posing a significant challenge to auto-regressive models. Interestingly, performance is significantly boosted when we prompt models to generate a complete A* search algorithm - a comparatively more cognitively difficult task. This approach effectively offloads the iterative search and backtracking process from the models, which they struggle with in text. This in-context learning baseline is further enhanced via a Multi-Stage-Multi-Try (MSMT) inference method, increasing GPT-4's rate of correct solutions to over 57%.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssemMate: Graph-Based LLM for Robotic Assembly Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11617v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based robotic assembly assistance has gained significant research attention. It requires the injection of domain-specific knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content, they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and real-world settings.

| **[Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.</p></details> | under review |

Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confusion is the Final Barrier: Rethinking Jailbreak Evaluation and Investigating the Real Misuse Threat of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16347v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p></details> |  |

This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attack, where an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an Large Language Model (LLM) follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task, represent a critical security threat. Existing attacks primarily focus on crafting these injections at inference time, treating the LLM itself as a static target. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we introduces a more foundational attack vector: poisoning the LLM's alignment process to amplify the success of future prompt injection attacks. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method that strategically creates poisoned alignment samples to poison an LLM's alignment dataset. Our experiments across five LLMs and two alignment datasets show that when even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned, the resulting model becomes substantially more vulnerable to a wide range of prompt injection attacks. Crucially, this vulnerability is instilled while the LLM's performance on standard capability benchmarks remains largely unchanged, making the manipulation difficult to detect through automated, general-purpose performance evaluations. The code for implementing the attack is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding in Latent Spaces for Efficient Inference in LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11524v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for recommendation in a generative manner has delivered promising results, but encounters significant inference overhead due to autoregressive decoding in the language space. This work explores bypassing language-space decoding by directly matching candidate items with the LLM's internal thought representations in the latent space, eliminating the time-consuming autoregressive process to reduce computational costs. Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an effective and efficient latent-space decoding method. L2D represents user-preferred items by using the hidden states of test sequences reflecting the LLM's internal thought, and obtains candidate item representations from the hidden states of training sequences labeled with the corresponding candidate items. It then matches the two types of representations to decode items, achieving latent-space decoding. In this way, it enables efficient decoding without altering the LLM's generative tuning paradigm, thereby preserving performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that L2D is more than 10x faster than language-space decoding while maintaining or enhancing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in EMNLP'25</p></details> |

However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Diverse real-world APIs demand precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks, tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model, AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named AgentFounder.

In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

While AI offers potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design. Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes, regulated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at HICSS-59 (2026), forthcoming in Proceedings</p></details> |

At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in hard variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |

Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, keywords: Automated Feature Engineering, Tabular Dataset, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Feature Selection</p></details> |

While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures with appendix</p></details> |

However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity allocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic risk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that integrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining advanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based hedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes portfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone models, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management in complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper contributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems (PACIS 2025), Kuala Lumpur.

| **[AMAZe: A Multi-Agent Zero-shot Index Advisor for Relational Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16044v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Index recommendation is one of the most important problems in database management system (DBMS) optimization. Given queries and certain index-related constraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or learning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose AMAZe, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning, selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes high-level agents to control the index selection process and low-level agents to select and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed AMAZe not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.</p></details> |  |

However, our field's focus on a human in the sensemaking loop raises critical questions about autonomy, delegation, and coordination for such \textit{agentic visualization} that preserve human agency while amplifying analytical capabilities. This paper addresses these questions by reinterpreting existing visualization systems with semi-automated or fully automatic AI components through an agentic lens. Based on this analysis, we extract a collection of design patterns for agentic visualization, including agentic roles, communication and coordination. These patterns provide a foundation for future agentic visualization systems that effectively harness AI agents while maintaining human insight and control.</p></details> |  |

Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops</p></details> |

To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark, GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test) execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Agentic Lybic, a novel multi-agent system where the entire architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations, Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark, Agentic Lybic achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a run-wise certificate that couples each node's key to the same exponential race that realizes leaf perturbations; the usual halting rule (stop when the maximum over $v$ in $F$ of Key$(v) \le B^*$) then certifies the realized run. We give two certified modes on context-indexed prefix DAGs with child partition: (i) Exact (known counts), using lazy offset propagation with winner reuse; and (ii) Surrogate (upper bounds only), which anchors keys to a parent-level surrogate race and allows validator tightening via $\kappa = \log(N / N_{ub}$). A small compiler enforces the partition property, and an admissible, race-independent M(tau) keeps keys sound. The ledger logs uniforms, counts, and tie handling; privacy follows by post-processing. Experiments on synthetic graphs and a small real pipeline show tight stopping, deterministic replay, and low overhead.</p></details> |  |

A key driver is the cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches, Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription, intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMATE: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16281v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/nlp2ct-shijie/HiMATE.</p></details> |  |

However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2504.15474</p></details> |

To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents, equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the effectiveness and value of our framework.</p></details> |  |

| **[Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02153v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation. Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems, and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm. Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents.</p></details> |  |

Graph-Based Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12484v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics, where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed, non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, to generate high-quality images, users must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and context-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor, a novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization process. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work collaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive, refined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework effectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To iteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified prompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user feedback for further refinement.

| **[From Legacy Fortran to Portable Kokkos: An Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12443v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues. A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs. While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting. \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses. We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters). To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches. On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p></details> |  |

We consider a team of robots tasked with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments involving different formations, communication topologies, scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving formation performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FLARE (Flying Learning Agents for Resource Efficiency), a learning-enabled aerial intelligence framework that jointly optimizes UAV positioning, altitude, transmit power, and bandwidth allocation in real-time. To adapt to UE mobility, we employ Silhouette-based K-Means clustering, enabling dynamic grouping of users and UAVs' deployment at cluster centroids for efficient service delivery. The problem is modeled as a multi-agent control task, with bandwidth discretized into resource blocks and power treated as a continuous variable. To solve this, our proposed framework, FLARE, employs a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that combines Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance learning efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances user coverage, achieving a 73.45% improvement in the number of served users under a 5 Mbps data rate constraint, outperforming MADDPG baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, accepted to IEEE Networking Letters</p></details> |
| **[Shell or Nothing: Real-World Benchmarks and Memory-Activated Agents for Automated Penetration Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09207v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration testing is critical for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, yet traditional approaches remain expensive, time-consuming, and dependent on expert human labor. Recent work has explored AI-driven pentesting agents, but their evaluation relies on oversimplified capture-the-flag (CTF) settings that embed prior knowledge and reduce complexity, leading to performance estimates far from real-world practice. We close this gap by introducing the first real-world, agent-oriented pentesting benchmark, TermiBench, which shifts the goal from 'flag finding' to achieving full system control. The benchmark spans 510 hosts across 25 services and 30 CVEs, with realistic environments that require autonomous reconnaissance, discrimination between benign and exploitable services, and robust exploit execution. Using this benchmark, we find that existing systems can hardly obtain system shells under realistic conditions. To address these challenges, we propose TermiAgent, a multi-agent penetration testing framework. TermiAgent mitigates long-context forgetting with a Located Memory Activation mechanism and builds a reliable exploit arsenal via structured code understanding rather than naive retrieval. In evaluations, our work outperforms state-of-the-art agents, exhibiting stronger penetration testing capability, reducing execution time and financial cost, and demonstrating practicality even on laptop-scale deployments. Our work delivers both the first open-source benchmark for real-world autonomous pentesting and a novel agent framework that establishes a milestone for AI-driven penetration testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuantAgent: Price-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for High-Frequency Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09995v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming random prediction baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</p></details> |  |

Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p></details> |  |

We present a human-in-the-loop (HITL) conceptual framework informed by theories of human web browsing behavior. The framework centers on an iterative loop in which the BUA proactively proposes next actions and the user steers the browsing process through feedback. It also distinguishes between exploration and exploitation actions, enabling users to control the breadth and depth of their browsing. Consequently, the framework aims to reduce users' physical and cognitive effort while preserving users' traditional browsing mental model and supporting users in achieving satisfactory outcomes. We illustrate how the framework operates with hypothetical use cases and discuss the shift from manual browsing to interaction-driven browsing. We contribute a theoretically informed conceptual framework for BUAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |

Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level understanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer visual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software systems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to evaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing approach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly from code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to standardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the first exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual documentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that combines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code and produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation framework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual documentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our approach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an improvement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation framework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual documentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding 0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual documentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid visual representations but also reliably assess their quality.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional code generation, these agents decompose goals, coordinate multi-step processes, and adapt based on feedback, reshaping software development practices. This survey provides a timely review of the field, introducing a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures and examining relevant techniques for planning, context management, tool integration, execution monitoring, and benchmarking datasets. We highlight challenges of this fast-moving field and discuss opportunities for building reliable, transparent, and collaborative coding agents.</p></details> |  |

Through a formative study (N=15), we found users frequently misunderstand agents' data practices, and desired unobtrusive, transparent data management. To achieve this, we designed and implemented PrivWeb, a trusted add-on on web agents that utilizes a localized LLM to anonymize private information on interfaces according to user preferences. It features privacy categorization schema and adaptive notifications that selectively pauses tasks for user control over information collection for highly sensitive information, while offering non-disruptive options for less sensitive information, minimizing human oversight. The user study (N=14) across travel, information retrieval, shopping, and entertainment tasks compared PrivWeb with baselines without notification and without control for private information access, where PrivWeb reduced perceived privacy risks with no associated increase in cognitive effort, and resulted in higher overall satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

EgoMem enables real-time models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users' facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead. We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal, and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.</p></details> |  |

Agent responses appear in the familiar comment feature. In a user study (N=30), 14 teams worked on writing projects during one week. Interaction logs and interviews show that teams incorporated agents into existing norms of authorship, control, and coordination, rather than treating them as team members. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory, while created agents and outputs became shared resources.

While some of their content is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.</p></details> |  |

Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Demo)</p></details> |
| **[$ε$-Optimal Multi-Agent Patrol using Recurrent Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11640v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multi-agent patrol problem refers to repeatedly visiting different locations in an environment using multiple autonomous agents. For over two decades, researchers have studied this problem in various settings. While providing valuable insights into the problem, the works in existing literature have not commented on the nature of the optimal solutions to the problem. We first show that an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy exists for every feasible patrol strategy. Then, we establish the existence of a recurrent patrol strategy that is an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to the General Patrol Problem. The factor $\epsilon$ is proportional to the discretisation constant $D$, which can be arbitrarily small and is independent of the number of patrol agents and the size of the environment. This result holds for a variety of problem formulations already studied. We also provide an algorithmic approach to determine an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy for a patrol strategy created by any method from the literature. We perform extensive simulations in graphs based on real-life environments to validate the claims made in this work.</p></details> |  |

We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</p></details> |  |

This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[VulAgent: Hypothesis-Validation based Multi-Agent Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11523v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of language models to project-level vulnerability detection remains challenging, owing to the dual requirement of accurately localizing security-sensitive code and correctly correlating and reasoning over complex program context. We present VulAgent, a multi-agent vulnerability detection framework based on hypothesis validation. Our design is inspired by how human auditors review code: when noticing a sensitive operation, they form a hypothesis about a possible vulnerability, consider potential trigger paths, and then verify the hypothesis against the surrounding context. VulAgent implements a semantics-sensitive, multi-view detection pipeline: specialized agents, each aligned to a specific analysis perspective (e.g., memory, authorization), collaboratively surface and precisely localize sensitive code sites with higher coverage. Building on this, VulAgent adopts a hypothesis-validation paradigm: for each vulnerability report, it builds hypothesis conditions and a trigger path, steering the LLM to target the relevant program context and defensive checks during verification, which reduces false positives. On average across the two datasets, VulAgent improves overall accuracy by 6.6%, increases the correct identification rate of vulnerable--fixed code pairs by up to 450% (246% on average), and reduces the false positive rate by about 36% compared with state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeDiver: Cooperative AUV-USV Assisted Diver Communication via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11508v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11507v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through conversation analysis (n=30), user surveys (n=19), and clinical validation against blinded specialist interviews (n=24). Symptoms detected by the agent aligned well with those identified by specialists across symptoms. Users appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. This preliminary work suggests conversational agents may serve as structured front-end tools for dementia assessment, highlighting interaction design considerations in sensitive healthcare contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Securing AI Agents: Implementing Role-Based Access Control for Industrial Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11431v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced solutions across various domains, from political science to software development. However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPGD: Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent for Collaborative Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11361v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often rely on a single optimization trajectory, limiting adaptability and efficiency while suffering from narrow perspectives, gradient conflicts, and high computational cost. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees. Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks (recent progress has pushed the frontier further, with RepoMaster+Claude 3.5 achieving a new record of 62.96%). Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Highl...</summary><p>Highly practical, Well-motivated, Actionable</p></details> |

Users' Judgments of Virtual Agent Personality and Appeals in Encounters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11342v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating multi-sensory cues into Virtual Reality (VR) can significantly enhance user experiences, mirroring the multi-sensory interactions we encounter in the real-world. Olfaction plays a crucial role in shaping impressions when engaging with others. This study examines how non-verbal cues from virtual agents-specifically olfactory cues, emotional expressions, and gender-influence user perceptions during encounters with virtual agents. Our findings indicate that in unscented, woodsy, and floral scent conditions, participants primarily relied on visually observable cues to form their impressions of virtual agents. Positive emotional expressions, conveyed through facial expressions and gestures, contributed to more favorable impressions, with this effect being stronger for the female agent than the male agent. However, in the unpleasant scent condition, participants consistently formed negative impressions, which overpowered the influence of emotional expressions and gender, suggesting that aversive olfactory stimuli can detrimentally impact user perceptions. Our results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting olfactory stimuli when designing immersive and engaging VR interactions. Finally, we present our findings and outline future research directions for effectively integrating olfactory cues into virtual agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIssistant: An Agentic Approach for Human--AI Collaborative Scientific Work on Reviews and Perspectives in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12282v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic, open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions. The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and incomplete integration of multimodal content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realistic Environmental Injection Attacks on GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11250v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI agents built on LVLMs are increasingly used to interact with websites. However, their exposure to open-world content makes them vulnerable to Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs) that hijack agent behavior via webpage elements. Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can only upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier assumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still fall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context remain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an unrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model where the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and embedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing attacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model. To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an attack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment Simulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage simulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention weights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward the trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4 representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that both novelties are critical to performance. Our findings reveal underexplored vulnerabilities in modern GUI agents and establish a robust foundation for future research on defense in open-world GUI agent systems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/attack2gui.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding, symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats, constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns. The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize, implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and reproducible deployment paths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Large Language Models for Music & Audio Workshop (LLM4MA) 2025</p></details> |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names, while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000 tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset, Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides an overview of the evolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents, highlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the entry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to advance the development of data agents into intelligent statistical analysis software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difficulty-Aware Agent Orchestration in LLM-Powered Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11079v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p></details> |  |

While learners can interact with academic papers through LLM-powered dialogue, limitations still exist: absence of structured organization and high text reliance can impede systematic understanding and engagement with complex concepts. To address these challenges, we propose Auto-Slides, an LLM-driven system that converts research papers into pedagogically structured, multimodal slides (e.g., diagrams and tables). Drawing on cognitive science, it creates a presentation-oriented narrative and allows iterative refinement via an interactive editor, in order to match learners' knowledge level and goals. Auto-Slides further incorporates verification and knowledge retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual completeness. Through extensive user studies, Auto-Slides enhances learners' comprehension and engagement compared to conventional LLM-based reading. Our contributions lie in designing a multi-agent framework for transforming academic papers into pedagogically optimized slides and introducing interactive customization for personalized learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Homepage: https://auto-slides.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Free-MAD: Consensus-Free Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11035v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process, causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning performance. To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD} introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |

An agentic AI workflow is presented that converts a lightweight, human-readable specification into a compiled, parallel, and differentiable model calibration pipeline. Users supply an XML description of the problem and fill in a Python code skeleton; the agent automatically validates consistency between problem definition and code, and auto-corrects pathologies in the input deck. It transforms Python callables into pure JAX functions for efficient just-in-time compilation and parallelization. The system then orchestrates a two-stage search comprising global exploration of the parameter space followed by gradient-based refinement. The result is an AD-native, reproducible workflow that lowers the barrier to advanced calibration while preserving expert control. An open-source implementation with a documented API and examples is released, enabling rapid movement from problem statement to interpretable ODE models with minimal effort.</p></details> |  |

This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p></details> |  |

Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

| **[AgentArch: A Comprehensive Benchmark to Evaluate Agent Architectures in Enterprise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10769v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p></details> |  |

Previous video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces, leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |
| **[Dark Patterns Meet GUI Agents: LLM Agent Susceptibility to Manipulative Interfaces and the Role of Human Oversight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10723v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dark patterns, deceptive interface designs manipulating user behaviors, have been extensively studied for their effects on human decision-making and autonomy. Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables (22 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, and more. Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. For example, when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90\% of trials (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100\%. We also demonstrate that these attacks succeed even if individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions. We hope that these results will motivate development of trust and security models for multi-agent systems before they are widely deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, designing reward functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative approaches never witness a single successful trial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website with videos https://chirayu-n.github.io/gcmarl and code https://github.com/Chirayu-N/gc-marl are online</p></details> |

Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

| **[Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore, different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents, such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALRPHFS: Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast \& Slow Reasoning for Robust Agent Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19260v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM Agents are becoming central to intelligent systems. However, their deployment raises serious safety concerns. Existing defenses largely rely on "Safety Checks", which struggle to capture the complex semantic risks posed by harmful user inputs or unsafe agent behaviors - creating a significant semantic gap between safety checks and real-world risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel defense framework, ALRPHFS (Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast & Slow Reasoning). ALRPHFS consists of two core components: (1) an offline adversarial self-learning loop to iteratively refine a generalizable and balanced library of risk patterns, substantially enhancing robustness without retraining the base LLM, and (2) an online hierarchical fast & slow reasoning engine that balances detection effectiveness with computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared to existing baselines, achieving a best-in-class average accuracy of 80% and exhibiting strong generalizability across agents and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 findings, 20 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.</p></details> |  |
| **[DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.</p></details> |  |

Such environments give agents a proper training space where they can learn from errors without impacting real users. RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations. It marks an important first step toward recommender systems where users and agents collaboratively shape personalized information streams. We envision new interaction paradigms where "user instructs, recommender responds," jointly optimizing user retention and engagement.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions, as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for automating and scaling social robot control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 demo-video and repository link</p></details> |

| **[A Holistic Architecture for Monitoring and Optimization of Robust Multi-Agent Path Finding Plan Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10284v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a fleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their goals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots executing the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk. Although robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the presence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the duration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become significant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the original plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan which will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide when to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this paper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans, its monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called Action Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution duration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the potential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We empirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator which we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous warehouse robotic fleet.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10222v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning.</p></details> |  |

As a first step toward this vision, we present a multi-agent system for literature-informed force field extraction and automated RASPA simulation setup. Initial evaluations demonstrate high correctness and reproducibility, highlighting this approach's potential to enable fully autonomous, scalable materials characterization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving and Energy-Aware Resource Management in 6G Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10163v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility, and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G edge networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Agent Economies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10147v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct human oversight. We propose the "sandbox economy" as a framework for analyzing this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins (emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy, presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the design of AI "mission economies" to coordinate around achieving collective goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's long-term collective flourishing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tangential Action Spaces: Geometry, Memory and Cost in Holonomic and Nonholonomic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03399v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living systems balance energetic efficiency with the capacity for path-dependent effects. We introduce Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a geometric framework that models embodied agents as hierarchies of manifolds linked by projections from physical states to cognitive representations and onward to intentions. Lifts from intentions back to actions may follow multiple routes that differ in energy cost and in whether they leave memory-like traces. Under explicit assumptions, we prove: (i) if the physical-to-cognitive map is locally invertible, there is a unique lift that minimises instantaneous energy and yields no path-dependent memory; any memory requires strictly positive excess energy. (ii) If multiple physical states map to a cognitive state (a fibration), the energy-minimising lift is the metric-weighted pseudoinverse of the projection. (iii) In systems with holonomy, excess energy grows quadratically with the size of the induced memory for sufficiently small loops, establishing a local cost-memory law. These results motivate a classification of embodied systems by the origin of path dependence: intrinsically conservative, conditionally conservative, geometrically nonconservative, and dynamically nonconservative. Numerical examples illustrate each case. We also present a reflective extension (rTAS) in which perception depends on a learnable model state; a block metric formalises an effort-learning trade-off, and cross-curvature terms couple physical and model holonomy. Simulations of single- and two-agent settings show role asymmetries and sensitivity to coupling. TAS provides a geometric language linking embodiment, memory, and energetic cost, yielding testable predictions and design guidelines for biological and robotic systems.</p></details> | 41 pages, 16 figures |
