| **[ThinkGeo: Evaluating Tool-Augmented Agents for Remote Sensing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23752v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing. Our code and dataset are publicly available</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents, where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward. Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance, consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes a contextual bandit algorithm that prevents strategic agents from misreporting while having approximate incentive compatibility and a sub-linear regret guarantee</p></details> |
| **[The Agentic Economy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15799v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic opportunity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAgent: Reversible Multi-Agent Reasoning for Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Hop QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06951v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-hop question answering (QA) through direct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.</p></details> | 25pages, 3 figures |
| **[Data-to-Dashboard: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Insightful Visualization in Enterprise Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23695v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of LLMs has led to the creation of diverse agentic systems in data analysis, utilizing LLMs' capabilities to improve insight generation and visualization. In this paper, we present an agentic system that automates the data-to-dashboard pipeline through modular LLM agents capable of domain detection, concept extraction, multi-perspective analysis generation, and iterative self-reflection. Unlike existing chart QA systems, our framework simulates the analytical reasoning process of business analysts by retrieving domain-relevant knowledge and adapting to diverse datasets without relying on closed ontologies or question templates. We evaluate our system on three datasets across different domains. Benchmarked against GPT-4o with a single-prompt baseline, our approach shows improved insightfulness, domain relevance, and analytical depth, as measured by tailored evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessment. This work contributes a novel modular pipeline to bridge the path from raw data to visualization, and opens new opportunities for human-in-the-loop validation by domain experts in business analytics.

| **[GSO: Challenging Software Optimization Tasks for Evaluating SWE-Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23671v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://gso-bench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Securing AI Agents with Information-Flow Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23643v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable, ensuring their security against vulnerabilities such as prompt injection becomes critical. This paper explores the use of information-flow control (IFC) to provide security guarantees for AI agents. We present a formal model to reason about the security and expressiveness of agent planners. Using this model, we characterize the class of properties enforceable by dynamic taint-tracking and construct a taxonomy of tasks to evaluate security and utility trade-offs of planner designs. Informed by this exploration, we present Fides, a planner that tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces security policies, and introduces novel primitives for selectively hiding information. Its evaluation in AgentDojo demonstrates that this approach broadens the range of tasks that can be securely accomplished. A tutorial to walk readers through the the concepts introduced in the paper can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/fides</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization of Interaction Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08805v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent simulations are versatile tools for exploring interactions among natural and artificial agents, but their development typically demands domain expertise and manual effort. This work introduces the Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization (GAMA) framework, which automates the formalization of interaction scenarios in simulations using agents augmented with large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate the application of GAMA, we use natural language descriptions of game-theoretic scenarios representing social interactions, and we autoformalize them into executable logic programs defining game rules, with syntactic correctness enforced through a solver-based validation. To ensure runtime validity, an iterative, tournament-based procedure tests the generated rules and strategies, followed by exact semantic validation when ground truth outcomes are available. In experiments with 110 natural language descriptions across five 2x2 simultaneous-move games, GAMA achieves 100% syntactic and 76.5% semantic correctness with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 99.82% syntactic and 77% semantic correctness with GPT-4o. The framework also shows high semantic accuracy in autoformalizing agents' strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/GAMA</p></details> |
| **[Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[LifelongAgentBench: Evaluating LLM Agents as Lifelong Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11942v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[From Lived Experience to Insight: Unpacking the Psychological Risks of Using AI Conversational Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07951v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent gains in popularity of AI conversational agents have led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences of individuals. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through the lived experiences of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 people with lived mental health experience and workshops involving experts with lived experience to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette-based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables; Accepted at ACM FAccT 2025</p></details> |
| **[X-TURING: Towards an Enhanced and Efficient Turing Test for Long-Term Dialogue Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09853v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Turing test examines whether AIs exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes \textbf{\textsc{X-Turing}}, which enhances the original test with a \textit{burst dialogue} pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the \textit{pseudo-dialogue} history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the \textit{X-Turn Pass-Rate} metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9\% and 38.9\% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[SafeScientist: Toward Risk-Aware Scientific Discoveries by LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23559v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist. \textcolor{red}{Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Going from a Representative Agent to Counterfactuals in Combinatorial Choice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23546v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study decision-making problems where data comprises points from a collection of binary polytopes, capturing aggregate information stemming from various combinatorial selection environments. We propose a nonparametric approach for counterfactual inference in this setting based on a representative agent model, where the available data is viewed as arising from maximizing separable concave utility functions over the respective binary polytopes. Our first contribution is to precisely characterize the selection probabilities representable under this model and show that verifying the consistency of any given aggregated selection dataset reduces to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Building on this characterization, we develop a nonparametric method for counterfactual prediction. When data is inconsistent with the model, finding a best-fitting approximation for prediction reduces to solving a compact mixed-integer convex program. Numerical experiments based on synthetic data demonstrate the method's flexibility, predictive accuracy, and strong representational power even under model misspecification.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Of Mice and Machines: A Comparison of Learning Between Real World Mice and RL Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12204v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.</p></details> | 19 pages, ICML 2025 |
| **[TRAP: Targeted Redirecting of Agentic Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23518v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios, TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Logically Sound Natural Language Reasoning with Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16081v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as general-purpose reasoners, particularly in agentic contexts. However, their outputs remain prone to mathematical and logical errors. This is especially challenging in open-ended tasks, where unstructured outputs lack explicit ground truth and may contain subtle inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA), a framework that integrates LLMs with formal logic to enable validation and refinement of natural language reasoning. LELMA comprises three components: an LLM-Reasoner, an LLM-Translator, and a Solver, and employs autoformalization to translate reasoning into logic representations, which are then used to assess logical validity. Using game-theoretic scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma as testbeds, we highlight the limitations of both less capable (Gemini 1.0 Pro) and advanced (GPT-4o) models in generating logically sound reasoning. LELMA achieves high accuracy in error detection and improves reasoning correctness via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4o. The study also highlights challenges in autoformalization accuracy and in evaluation of inherently ambiguous open-ended reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/LELMA</p></details> |
| **[MegaAgent: A Large-Scale Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent System Without Predefined SOPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09955v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise in tackling complex tasks. However, existing solutions often suffer from limited agent coordination and heavy reliance on predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which demand extensive human input. To address these limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a large-scale autonomous LLM-based multi-agent system. MegaAgent generates agents based on task complexity and enables dynamic task decomposition, parallel execution, efficient communication, and comprehensive system monitoring of agents. In evaluations, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional performance, successfully developing a Gobang game within 800 seconds and scaling up to 590 agents in a national policy simulation to generate multi-domain policies. It significantly outperforms existing systems, such as MetaGPT, in both task completion efficiency and scalability. By eliminating the need for predefined SOPs, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional scalability and autonomy, setting a foundation for advancing true autonomy in MAS.

| **[Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03553v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowSelf.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23450v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedures (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6\%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1\% and OpenVLA by 7.4\% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

| **[The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20579v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Risk Awareness in Rational Agents under Resource Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23436v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  |

While existing open-source SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories as the likely source of the performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short Paper, REALM '25 camera-ready</p></details> |

This novel formalism combines the features of hypersequents to represent S5 modalities with nested sequents to represent the T-like modality alternations. We show that the calculus is sound and complete, cut-free, and terminating and yields decidability and the finite model property for multi-agent S5. We also use it to prove the Lyndon (and hence Craig) interpolation property for multi-agent S5, considering not only propositional atoms but also agents to be part of the common language. Finally, we discuss the difficulties on the way to extending these results to the logic of distributed knowledge and to deductive interpolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Information Propagation Effects of Communication Topologies in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23352v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous, propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness, communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wireless Agentic AI with Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23275v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced real-time interaction, decision-making, and collaborative tasks. However, in wireless multi-agent scenarios, limited bandwidth poses significant challenges to exchanging semantically rich multimodal information efficiently. Traditional semantic communication methods, though effective, struggle with redundancy and loss of crucial details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Communication (RAMSemCom) framework. RAMSemCom incorporates iterative, retrieval-driven semantic refinement tailored for distributed multi-agent environments, enabling efficient exchange of critical multimodal elements through local caching and selective transmission. Our approach dynamically optimizes retrieval using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance semantic fidelity with bandwidth constraints. A comprehensive case study on multi-agent autonomous driving demonstrates that our DRL-based retrieval strategy significantly improves task completion efficiency and reduces communication overhead compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed SOTOPIA-$\Omega$ framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects multi-step reasoning strategies inspired by negotiation theory and two simple direct strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of a high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that complement social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpass the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhance S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in suboptimal performance. To develop strategic language agents, i.e., agents that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2024</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce OSS-UAgent, an automated, configurable, and interactive agent-based usability evaluation framework specifically designed for open source software. Our framework employs intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to simulate developers performing programming tasks across various experience levels (from Junior to Expert). By dynamically constructing platform-specific knowledge bases, OSS-UAgent ensures accurate and context-aware code generation. The generated code is automatically evaluated across multiple dimensions, including compliance, correctness, and readability, providing a comprehensive measure of the software's usability. Additionally, our demonstration showcases OSS-UAgent's practical application in evaluating graph analytics platforms, highlighting its effectiveness in automating usability evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo.

A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away the low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Task Experiential Learning on LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23187v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase, we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Text-to-Decision Agent: Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15046v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline meta-RL usually tackles generalization by inferring task beliefs from high-quality samples or warmup explorations. The restricted form limits their generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{A}gent (\textbf{T2DA}), a simple and scalable framework that supervises offline meta-RL with natural language. We first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of baselines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.</p></details> |  |

While artists leverage expertise to create unique visual effects through deliberate adjustments, non-professional users often rely on automated tools that produce visually pleasing results but lack interpretative depth and interactive transparency. In this paper, we introduce PhotoArtAgent, an intelligent system that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with advanced natural language reasoning to emulate the creative process of a professional artist. The agent performs explicit artistic analysis, plans retouching strategies, and outputs precise parameters to Lightroom through an API. It then evaluates the resulting images and iteratively refines them until the desired artistic vision is achieved. Throughout this process, PhotoArtAgent provides transparent, text-based explanations of its creative rationale, fostering meaningful interaction and user control. Experimental results show that PhotoArtAgent not only surpasses existing automated tools in user studies but also achieves results comparable to those of professional human artists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Incentivize in Repeated Principal-Agent Problems with Adversarial Agent Arrivals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23124v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</p></details> |  |

Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\% (synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM prompting approaches.

In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5% improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods.

To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents which are capable of completing tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets.

Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE ICLAD 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p></details> |  |

We explore this through the case of prototyping Large Language Model-driven non-player characters (NPCs). We present Agentic H-CI, a framework that mirrors traditional user research processes-surveying, screening, experiencing, and collecting feedback and insights-with simulated agents. Using this approach, we easily construct a team of 240 player agents with a balanced range of player types and personality traits, at extremely low cost (\$0.28/player) and minimal time commitment (6.9 minutes/player). Content analysis shows that agent-based players behave in ways aligned with their simulated backgrounds, achieving 82.5\% alignment with designated profiles. From their interactions, we distill 11 user insights and 6 design implications to guide further development. To evaluate practical value, we conduct parallel user studies with human participants recruited locally and via crowdsourcing. Ratings from three professional game developers show that the agentic player team offers a Pareto-optimal and well-balanced trade-off across fidelity, cost, time efficiency, and insight helpfulness.</p></details> |  |

We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. Reference solutions for each task are provided to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e., crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study of Conditional Effectiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22960v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Darwin Godel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine (DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/jennyzzt/dgm</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Bias Reinforcement in LLM Agents Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.</p></details> | Submitted ITSC 2025 |

However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents--those who frequently make errors in their tasks--on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches--AutoTransform and AutoInject--which introduce mistakes into the agents' responses. Experiments on four downstream tasks using six systems show that the "hierarchical" structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of 5.5%, compared to 10.5% and 23.7% of other two structures. To further improve resilience, we introduce (1) Challenger, that introduces a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, and (2) Inspector, an additional agent to review and correct messages, recovering up to 96.4% errors made by faulty agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/MAS-Resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main text; 12 pages of appendix</p></details> |

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger policies can.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Allocations in Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design: Bridging Multiple Levels of Service and Divisible Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07385v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Budget-feasible procurement has been a major paradigm in mechanism design since its introduction by Singer (2010). An auctioneer (buyer) with a strict budget constraint is interested in buying goods or services from a group of strategic agents (sellers). In many scenarios it makes sense to allow the auctioneer to only partially buy what an agent offers, e.g., an agent might have multiple copies of an item to sell, they might offer multiple levels of a service, or they may be available to perform a task for any fraction of a specified time interval. Nevertheless, the focus of the related literature has been on settings where each agent's services are either fully acquired or not at all. The main reason for this, is that in settings with partial allocations like the ones mentioned, there are strong inapproximability results. Under the mild assumption of being able to afford each agent entirely, we are able to circumvent such results in this work. We design a polynomial-time, deterministic, truthful, budget-feasible $(2+\sqrt{3})$-approximation mechanism for the setting where each agent offers multiple levels of service and the auctioneer has a discrete separable concave valuation function. We then use this result to design a deterministic, truthful and budget-feasible $O(1)$-approximation mechanism for the setting where any fraction of a service can be acquired and the auctioneer's valuation function is separable concave (i.e., the sum of concave functions). For the special case of a linear valuation function, we improve the best known approximation ratio for the problem from $1+\phi$ (by Klumper & Sch\"afer (2022)) to $2$. This establishes a separation between this setting and its indivisible counterpart.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown that, under assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and policy gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we consider, provides a useful model for extensions to additional problems in wireless communications and radar networks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement. We highlight the importance of thorough premise selection for generating Rocq proofs and propose a novel approach, leveraging retrieval via a self-attentive embedder model. The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and show the use of multi-agent debate on the planning stage of proof synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model-Enabled Control Architecture for Dynamic Resource Capability Exploration in Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22814v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient resource utilization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In MAPF, a team of agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF, new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT). Experimental results show that using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in overall system throughput for LMAPF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Compared to typical household environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning, making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene, a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii) LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30 distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments. We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper posits the imperative for a novel Agentic AI IAM framework: We deconstruct the limitations of existing protocols when applied to MAS, illustrating with concrete examples why their coarse-grained controls, single-entity focus, and lack of context-awareness falter. We then propose a comprehensive framework built upon rich, verifiable Agent Identities (IDs), leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), that encapsulate an agents capabilities, provenance, behavioral scope, and security posture. Our framework includes an Agent Naming Service (ANS) for secure and capability-aware discovery, dynamic fine-grained access control mechanisms, and critically, a unified global session management and policy enforcement layer for real-time control and consistent revocation across heterogeneous agent communication protocols. We also explore how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable privacy-preserving attribute disclosure and verifiable policy compliance. We outline the architecture, operational lifecycle, innovative contributions, and security considerations of this new IAM paradigm, aiming to establish the foundational trust, accountability, and security necessary for the burgeoning field of agentic AI and the complex ecosystems they will inhabit.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, edit: added a missed Author</p></details> |

However, there is a lack of a tool that enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems. HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain. Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of ICAPS 2025</p></details> |

Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by journal Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |

However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge. We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge. With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.</p></details> |  |

Based on a randomized controlled trial, three instructional conditions were compared: a traditional human teacher, a self-paced MOOC with chatbot support, and an AI instructional agent capable of delivering lectures and responding to questions in real time. Students in the AI instructional agent group reported significantly higher levels of perceived learner control compared to the other groups. They also completed the learning task more efficiently and engaged in more frequent interactions with the instructional system. Regression analyzes showed that perceived learner control positively predicted post-test performance, with behavioral indicators such as reduced learning time and higher interaction frequency supporting this relationship. These findings suggest that AI instructional agents, when designed to support personalized pace and responsive interaction, can enhance both students' learning experience and learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming the Machine Penalty with Imperfectly Fair AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid technological progress, effective human-machine cooperation remains a significant challenge. Humans tend to cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon known as the machine penalty. Here, we show that artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models can overcome this penalty in social dilemma games with communication. In a pre-registered experiment with 1,152 participants, we deploy AI agents exhibiting three distinct personas: selfish, cooperative, and fair. However, only fair agents elicit human cooperation at rates comparable to human-human interactions. Analysis reveals that fair agents, similar to human participants, occasionally break pre-game cooperation promises, but nonetheless effectively establish cooperation as a social norm. These results challenge the conventional wisdom of machines as altruistic assistants or rational actors. Instead, our study highlights the importance of AI agents reflecting the nuanced complexity of human social behaviors -- imperfect yet driven by deeper social cognitive processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Strangers to Assistants: Fast Desire Alignment for Embodied Agent-User Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22503v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution. The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSearch: An Iterative Self-Evolving Search Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22501v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges: supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains, while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic capabilities in open web search domains.</p></details> |  |

However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 tables |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |

Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Interrogating such datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its answers and the correctness of the generated queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentDNS: A Root Domain Naming System for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22368v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning in Stackelberg Games with Non-myopic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09407v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future. We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications. On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended abstract of this work appeared at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC) 2022</p></details> |

This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main. Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.</p></details> |  |

Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to accurately capture stakeholder requirements remains a significant challenge for using FMs for software development. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities, our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers. This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation covering 150 diverse use cases, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately capture the intents and requirements of stakeholders, articulating them as both specifications and a step-by-step plan of action. Our findings suggest that the potential for significant improvements in the software development process justifies these investments. Our work lays the groundwork for future innovation in building intent-first development environments, where software makers can seamlessly collaborate with AIs to create software that truly meets their needs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Sentiment Simulation using Generative AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22125v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional sentiment analysis relies on surface-level linguistic patterns and retrospective data, limiting its ability to capture the psychological and contextual drivers of human sentiment. These limitations constrain its effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs, and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached 81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials (+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676, Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment formation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2 dr...</summary><p>V2 draft. Under review</p></details> |

However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Centric Personalized Multiple Clustering with Multi-Modal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22241v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences. However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations. To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of 0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively, largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.</p></details> |  |

Psychiatric differential diagnosis exemplifies this challenge: accurate assessments depend on nuanced clinical knowledge, a delicate cognitive-affective interview process, and downstream outcomes that extend far beyond benchmark accuracy. We present WiseMind, a systematic interdisciplinary contextualization framework that delivers both instrumental (diagnostic precision) and humanistic (empathy) gains. WiseMind comprises three components:(i) structured knowledge-guided proactive reasoning, which embeds DSM-5 criteria in a knowledge graph to steer questioning; (ii) a theory-informed dual-agent architecture that coordinates a "reasonable-mind" reasoning agent and an "emotional-mind" empathy agent, inspired by Dialectical Behavior Therapy; and (iii) a multi-faceted evaluation strategy covering simulated patients, user studies, clinician review, and ethical assessment. Tested on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, WiseMind attains up to 84.2% diagnostic accuracy, which is comparable to human experts, while outperforming single-agent baselines in perceived empathy and trustworthiness. These results show that deep contextualization-across knowledge, process, and evaluation layers-can transform benchmark-driven NLP into clinically meaningful impact.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[AudioGenie: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Multimodality-to-Multiaudio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22053v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodality-to-Multiaudio (MM2MA) generation faces significant challenges in synthesizing diverse and contextually aligned audio types (e.g., sound effects, speech, music, and songs) from multimodal inputs (e.g., video, text, images), owing to the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets and the lack of robust multi-task learning frameworks. Recently, multi-agent system shows great potential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA task presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained understanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of single models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of self-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs. To this end, we propose AudioGenie, a novel training-free multi-agent system featuring a dual-layer architecture with a generation team and a supervisor team. For the generation team, a fine-grained task decomposition and an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) collaborative entity are designed for dynamic model selection, and a trial-and-error iterative refinement module is designed for self-correction. The supervisor team ensures temporal-spatial consistency and verifies outputs through feedback loops. Moreover, we build MA-Bench, the first benchmark for MM2MA tasks, comprising 198 annotated videos with multi-type audios. Experiments demonstrate that our AudioGenie outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across 9 metrics in 8 tasks. User study further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of quality, accuracy, alignment, and aesthetic.

| **[Efficiently Enhancing General Agents With Hierarchical-categorical Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22006v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities, there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fact-R1: Towards Explainable Video Misinformation Detection with Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16836v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |
| **[CAMOUFLAGE: Exploiting Misinformation Detection Systems Through LLM-driven Adversarial Claim Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01900v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Misinformation Detection by Visiting Potential Commonsense Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21604v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Internet technology has led to an increased prevalence of misinformation, causing severe negative effects across diverse domains. To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts.

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

| **[Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unmasking Digital Falsehoods: A Comparative Analysis of LLM-Based Misinformation Detection Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00724v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Machine Learning for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12215v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models.

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on the Role of Crowds in Combating Online Misinformation: Annotators, Evaluators, and Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02095v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online misinformation poses a global risk with significant real-world consequences. To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD) Journal.

| **[Attacking Misinformation Detection Using Adversarial Examples Generated by Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20940v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061v2)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.

This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection.

A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19192v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D).

| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14321v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for misinformation detection and fact checking. Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |

Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/outcontext-misinfo-progress</p></details> |  |

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</p></details> |  |

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Examination on the Effectiveness of Divide-and-Conquer Prompting in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05359v6)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[How to Train Your Fact Verifier: Knowledge Transfer with Multimodal Open Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00369v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the growing influx of misinformation across news and social media, there is a critical need for systems that can provide effective real-time verification of news claims. Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMMA: Towards LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11943v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant challenges for individuals and societies. Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the highest increases of 20.69%, 23.94%, and 39.11% respectively. This work will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Missci: Reconstructing Fallacies in Misrepresented Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03181v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |

Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Capabilities of LLMs across Scale and Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03146v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying misleading versus non-misleading news headlines. Utilizing a dataset of 60 articles, sourced from both reputable and questionable outlets across health, science & tech, and business domains, we employ three LLMs- ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini-for classification. Our analysis reveals significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human judgment. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI ethics, emphasizing the need for models that are not only technically advanced but also ethically aligned and sensitive to the subtleties of human interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 tables, 1st HEAL Workshop at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 12, Honolulu, HI, USA 2024</p></details> |

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective.

Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-CoLING-2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</p></details> |  |

However, it is uncertain how the public may react to labels by automated fact-checkers. In this study, we investigate the use of automated warning labels derived from misinformation detection literature and investigate their effects on three forms of post engagement. Focusing on political posts, we also consider how partisanship affects engagement. In a two-phases within-subjects experiment with 200 participants, we found that the generic warnings suppressed intents to comment on and share posts, but not on the intent to like them. Furthermore, when different reasons for the labels were provided, their effects on post engagement were inconsistent, suggesting that the reasons could have undesirably motivated engagement instead. Partisanship effects were observed across the labels with higher engagement for politically congruent posts. We discuss the implications on the design and use of automated warning labels.</p></details> |  |

Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024</p></details> |

At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at K-CAP'23: The 12th Knowledge Capture Conference</p></details> |

Considerable efforts have focused on building misinformation detection models, still the perils of misinformation remain abound. Mitigating online misinformation and its ramifications requires a holistic approach that encompasses not only an understanding of its intricate landscape in relation to the complex issue and topic-rich information ecosystem online, but also the psychological drivers of individuals behind it. Adopting a time series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we conduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19 tweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the behavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19 and its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing misinformation on Non-COVID domains before the pandemic. Our analysis underscores the intricacies inherent to cross-domain misinformation, and highlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is positively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation sharing on emergent topics and beyond. This work may serve as a valuable foundation for designing user-centric inoculation strategies and ecologically-grounded agile interventions for effectively tackling online misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing GPT-4 and Open-Source Language Models in Misinformation Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06920v1)** | 2024-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective for misinformation detection. However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighting Fire with Fire: Adversarial Prompting to Generate a Misinformation Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04481v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success in language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Bard, Llama etc., can potentially lead to concerns about their possible misuse in inducing mass agitation and communal hatred via generating fake news and spreading misinformation. Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities, false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for the task of misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Resolution in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01197v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and distorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information. We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[ML-Agent: Reinforcing LLM Agents for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23723v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |

Disentangling Abstract Formulation From Arithmetic Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23701v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation. These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an agentic system that automates the data-to-dashboard pipeline through modular LLM agents capable of domain detection, concept extraction, multi-perspective analysis generation, and iterative self-reflection. Unlike existing chart QA systems, our framework simulates the analytical reasoning process of business analysts by retrieving domain-relevant knowledge and adapting to diverse datasets without relying on closed ontologies or question templates. We evaluate our system on three datasets across different domains. Benchmarked against GPT-4o with a single-prompt baseline, our approach shows improved insightfulness, domain relevance, and analytical depth, as measured by tailored evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessment. This work contributes a novel modular pipeline to bridge the path from raw data to visualization, and opens new opportunities for human-in-the-loop validation by domain experts in business analytics.

In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns -- specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries, emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |

However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers, and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and interpretability issues for automated software systems.</p></details> |  |

Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data.

To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks.

In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased? Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</p></details> |  |

As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Property-based Test Generation for Guardrailing Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23549v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems that integrate physical, computational, and communication subsystems. The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2) intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks.

However, existing solutions often suffer from limited agent coordination and heavy reliance on predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which demand extensive human input. To address these limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a large-scale autonomous LLM-based multi-agent system. MegaAgent generates agents based on task complexity and enables dynamic task decomposition, parallel execution, efficient communication, and comprehensive system monitoring of agents. In evaluations, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional performance, successfully developing a Gobang game within 800 seconds and scaling up to 590 agents in a national policy simulation to generate multi-domain policies. It significantly outperforms existing systems, such as MetaGPT, in both task completion efficiency and scalability. By eliminating the need for predefined SOPs, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional scalability and autonomy, setting a foundation for advancing true autonomy in MAS.

Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582 pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with 140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training. LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to 14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while ignoring broader context.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML'2025</p></details> |

While previous studies have built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation, we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges, as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may result in incorrect responses.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

This study systematically compares reasoning LLMs with non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation and text summarization evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models spanning state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3), their distilled variants (8B-70B parameters), and equivalent non-reasoning LLMs. Experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal architecture and task-dependent benefits: OpenAI o3-mini models show improved performance with increased reasoning on MT, while DeepSeek-R1 and generally underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant except in summarization consistency evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that reasoning token usage correlates with evaluation quality only in specific models, while almost all models generally allocate more reasoning tokens when identifying more quality issues. Distillation maintains reasonable performance up to 32B parameter models but degrades substantially at 8B scale. This work provides the first assessment of reasoning LLMs for NLG evaluation and comparison to non-reasoning models. We share our code to facilitate further research: https://github.com/NL2G/reasoning-eval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Mitigating Overrefusal in LLMs from an Unveiling Perspective of Safety Decision Boundary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18325v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages. Code and datasets will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have identified significant errors in the results presented in this paper, specifically in the evaluation sections concerning the DPO training of LLaMA2 and Qwen2.5, as well as in the representation space visualization section.

| **[LLM as Effective Streaming Processor: Bridging Streaming-Batch Mismatches with Group Position Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16983v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing. Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming and batch modes. The code is available at repository https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without requiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version for ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e., few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt, demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data selection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code of this paper will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[EFIM: Efficient Serving of LLMs for Infilling Tasks with Improved KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infilling capability. EFIM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>31st ...</summary><p>31st International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (Euro-Par 2025 Oral)</p></details> |

However, most existing methods treat the LLM and the retriever as separate modules, overlooking the alignment between generation and ranking objectives. In this work, we propose ExpandR, a unified LLM-augmented dense retrieval framework that jointly optimizes both the LLM and the retriever. ExpandR employs the LLM to generate semantically rich query expansions, which are leveraged to enhance the retriever's training. Simultaneously, the LLM is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), guided by a carefully designed reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and generation consistency. This joint optimization paradigm enables mutual adaptation between the LLM and the retriever, resulting in query expansions that are both informative and well-suited for retrieval. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that ExpandR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving more than a 5% improvement in retrieval performance.

Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate. We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While simulation and emulation are widely used, complete correctness can only be ensured based on formal proof techniques. But these approaches often have very high run time and memory requirements. Recently, Polynomial Formal Verification (PFV) has been introduced showing that for many instances of practical relevance upper bounds on needed resources can be given. But proofs have to be provided that are human-readable. Here, we study how modern approaches from Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate proofs that later on can be validated based on reasoning engines. Examples are given that show how LLMs can interact with proof engines, and directions for future work are outlined.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages; keynote given at 7th International Symposium on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ISDCS 2025), May 27-30, 2025, IIEST Shibpur, Kolkata, India</p></details> |

Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1) divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to 12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD datasets.</p></details> |  |

While supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250 training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight, data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in annotation-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |

As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs through Minimum Bayes Risk: Bridging Confidence and Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04964v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompass a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149 problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing compression methods typically require supervised training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark, Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context compression.

A Framework for Auditing Unlearning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23270v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.</p></details> |  |

Accurate prediction of their properties and functions is crucial in biological applications. Recent development of protein language models (pLMs) with supervised fine tuning provides a promising solution to this problem. However, the fine-tuned model is tailored for particular downstream prediction task, and achieving general-purpose protein understanding remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework to bridge this gap. Our approach incorporates a novel structure-aware module into pLMs to enrich their structural knowledge, and subsequently integrates these enhanced pLMs with large language models (LLMs) to advance protein understanding. In this framework, we propose a novel instruction tuning pipeline. First, we warm up the enhanced pLMs using contrastive learning and structure denoising. Then, caption-based instructions are used to establish a basic understanding of proteins. Finally, we refine this understanding by employing a mixture of experts (MoEs) to capture more complex properties and functional information with the same number of activated parameters. Moreover, we construct the largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date, which allows us to train and evaluate the general-purpose protein understanding model. Extensive experiments on both open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SEPIT over both closed-source general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 |

While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and small organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak CPU usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, stifling scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak overhead, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with standard SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Fine-grained speech emotion descriptor (SED) features, e.g., pitch, tone and emphasis, are disentangled from HuBERT SSL representations via alternating LLM fine-tuning to joint SER-SED prediction and ASR tasks. VAE compressed HuBERT features derived via Information Bottleneck (IB) are used to adjust feature granularity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms comparable LLaMA-based SER baselines, including those using either (a) alternating multi-task fine-tuning alone or (b) feature disentanglement only. Statistically significant increase of SER unweighted accuracy by up to 4.0% and 3.7% absolute (5.4% and 6.6% relative) are obtained. More importantly, emotion descriptors offer further explainability for SER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH2025</p></details> |

Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.</p></details> | ICML2025 Accepted |
| **[Ghidorah: Fast LLM Inference on Edge with Speculative Decoding and Hetero-Core Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23219v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-situ LLM inference on end-user devices has gained significant interest due to its privacy benefits and reduced dependency on external infrastructure. However, as the decoding process is memory-bandwidth-bound, the diverse processing units in modern end-user devices cannot be fully exploited, resulting in slow LLM inference. This paper presents Ghidorah, a LLM inference system for end-user devices with the unified memory architecture. The key idea of Ghidorah can be summarized in two steps: 1) leveraging speculative decoding approaches to enhance parallelism, and 2) ingeniously distributing workloads across multiple heterogeneous processing units to maximize computing power utilization. Ghidorah includes the hetero-core model parallelism (HCMP) architecture and the architecture-aware profiling (ARCA) approach. The HCMP architecture guides partitioning by leveraging the unified memory design of end-user devices and adapting to the hybrid computational demands of speculative decoding. The ARCA approach is used to determine the optimal speculative strategy and partitioning strategy, balancing acceptance rate with parallel capability to maximize the speedup. Additionally, we optimize sparse computation on ARM CPUs. Experimental results show that Ghidorah can achieve up to 7.6x speedup in the dominant LLM decoding phase compared to the sequential decoding approach in NVIDIA Jetson NX.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, most existing evaluation practices are not designed for LLM-generated topics and result in low inter-annotator agreement scores, hindering the reliable use of LLMs for the task. To address this, we introduce $T^5Score$, an evaluation methodology that decomposes the quality of a topic set into quantifiable aspects, measurable through easy-to-perform annotation tasks. This framing enables a convenient, manual or automatic, evaluation procedure resulting in a strong inter-annotator agreement score. To substantiate our methodology and claims, we perform extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and report the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

However, previous methods rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 12 figs/tables</p></details> |

However, existing approaches typically treat each task in isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase, we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Too Consistent to Detect: A Study of Self-Consistent Errors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17656v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Reason About Program Semantics? A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

These challenges are often exacerbated by misinformation caused by lack of verification, reasoning without attribution, and potential knowledge conflicts. We propose LongFaith, a novel pipeline for synthesizing faithful long-context reasoning instruction datasets. By integrating ground truth and citation-based reasoning prompts, we eliminate distractions and improve the accuracy of reasoning chains, thus mitigating the need for costly verification processes. We open-source two synthesized datasets, LongFaith-SFT and LongFaith-PO, which systematically address multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including verified reasoning, attribution, and contextual grounding. Extensive experiments on multi-hop reasoning datasets and LongBench demonstrate that models fine-tuned on these datasets significantly improve performance. Our ablation studies highlight the scalability and adaptability of the LongFaith pipeline, showcasing its broad applicability in developing long-context LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Readable Adversarial Prompts: An Investigation into LLM Vulnerabilities Using Situational Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16359v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the AI systems become deeply embedded in social media platforms, we've uncovered a concerning security vulnerability that goes beyond traditional adversarial attacks. It becomes important to assess the risks of LLMs before the general public use them on social media platforms to avoid any adverse impacts. Unlike obvious nonsensical text strings that safety systems can easily catch, our work reveals that human-readable situation-driven adversarial full-prompts that leverage situational context are effective but much harder to detect. We found that skilled attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs to make a malicious user query safe for LLMs, resulting in generating a harmful response. This raises an important question about the vulnerabilities of LLMs. To measure the robustness against human-readable attacks, which now present a potent threat, our research makes three major contributions. First, we developed attacks that use movie scripts as situational contextual frameworks, creating natural-looking full-prompts that trick LLMs into generating harmful content. Second, we developed a method to transform gibberish adversarial text into readable, innocuous content that still exploits vulnerabilities when used within the full-prompts. Finally, we enhanced the AdvPrompter framework with p-nucleus sampling to generate diverse human-readable adversarial texts that significantly improve attack effectiveness against models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and Gemma-7b. Our findings show that these systems can be manipulated to operate beyond their intended ethical boundaries when presented with seemingly normal prompts that contain hidden adversarial elements. By identifying these vulnerabilities, we aim to drive the development of more robust safety mechanisms that can withstand sophisticated attacks in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.14644</p></details> |
| **[To Judge or not to Judge: Using LLM Judgements for Advertiser Keyphrase Relevance at eBay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04209v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</p></details> |  |

We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the RAG-based approach with LLM feedback outperforms other methods evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics.

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available at https://github.com/docworlds/tsg-bench.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point improvement over unconstrained inference</p></details> | <details><summary>DINGO...</summary><p>DINGO an algorithm to provably apply constraints to diffusion LLM generations</p></details> |

However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.14228 by other authors</p></details> |

Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are available at https://github.com/Axel-gu/DenoiseRotator.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR), we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.</p></details> |  |

However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores potential manipulation scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate the negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets illustrate that evidence pollution significantly compromises detectors, where the generating strategy causes up to a 14.4% performance drop. Meanwhile, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence (i) is of high quality, evaluated by metrics and humans; (ii) would compromise the model calibration, increasing expected calibration error up to 21.6%; and (iii) could be integrated to amplify the negative impact, especially for encoder-based LMs, where the accuracy drops by 21.8%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We observe that most episodes in widely used benchmarks such as HM3D and MP3D involve multi-floor buildings, with many requiring explicit floor transitions. However, existing methods are often limited to single-floor settings or predefined object categories. To address these limitations, we tackle two key challenges: (1) efficient cross-level planning and (2) zero-shot object-goal navigation (ZS-OGN), where agents must interpret novel object descriptions without prior exposure. We propose ASCENT, a framework that combines a Multi-Floor Spatial Abstraction module for hierarchical semantic mapping and a Coarse-to-Fine Frontier Reasoning module leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware exploration, without requiring additional training on new object semantics or locomotion data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-OGN approaches on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks while enabling efficient multi-floor navigation. We further validate its practicality through real-world deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving successful object exploration across unseen floors.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

This work demonstrates that model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on 1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes. These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the continual advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |

In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated Chinese dataset, BPRF, which contains 50 business process documents with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule is represented as a <Condition, Action> pair, and we annotate logical dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also propose ExIde, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset, benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business process automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAVS: An LLM-based Labeler for Abdominal CT Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13330v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early acceptance (top 9% of submissions) for MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22961v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based HSE Compliance Assessment: Benchmark, Performance, and Advancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22959v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM. HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs, including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs for Argument Mining: Detection, Extraction, and Relationship Classification of pre-defined Arguments in Online Comments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22956v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks, their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online comments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Bias Reinforcement in LLM Agents Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and 9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content. These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training or task-specific tuning.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Adversarial Compositionality of Pre-trained Multimodal Representation via Text Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22943v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

However, existing web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks. We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by 10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Scalable Parameter and Memory Efficient Pretraining for LLM: Recent Algorithmic Advances and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22922v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[ER-REASON: A Benchmark Dataset for LLM-Based Clinical Reasoning in the Emergency Room](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22919v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mustafar: Promoting Unstructured Sparsity for KV Cache Pruning in LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22913v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p></details> |  |

These issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the research community in enhancing the security verification process.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) 2025</p></details> |

These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees. Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security and support scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

These models deliver competitive performance across healthcare benchmarks and medical fields, and are often preferred by healthcare professionals. On bias and toxicity, the Aloe Beta models significantly improve safety, showing resilience to unseen jailbreaking attacks. For a responsible release, a detailed risk assessment specific to healthcare is attached to the Aloe Family models. Conclusion: The Aloe Beta models, and the recipe that leads to them, are a significant contribution to the open-source medical LLM field, offering top-of-the-line performance while maintaining high ethical requirements.

| **[Highly Efficient and Effective LLMs with Multi-Boolean Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22811v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights, which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization methods.</p></details> | Under Review |

We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14774v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data for instruction-following. The pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following by directly prompting the model. This is inspired by ``LLM metacognition'' of Didolkar et al. (2024); (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty. The estimated cost of creating the dataset is under $600. Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just 4K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0, a level similar to frontier models like Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct. Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. In our dataset, adding 20% low quality answers (``shirkers'') causes a noticeable degradation in performance. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline seems flexible and adaptable to other settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[KVQuant: Towards 10 Million Context Length LLM Inference with KV Cache Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18079v6)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for KVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline fp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

A major challenge is the available benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.</p></details> | May ARR |

To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.</p></details> | 15 pages |

A Self-Adaptive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Domain-Specific Knowledge and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22661v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2) standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning for LLMs: A Case Study on Dietary Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00134v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

To achieve this, recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Main), 16 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

Recent studies have demonstrated that these weights can be used as input for frameworks designed to address deep learning tasks; however, such frameworks require NeRFs to adhere to a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we introduce the first framework capable of processing NeRFs with diverse architectures and performing inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this by training a Graph Meta-Network within an unsupervised representation learning framework, and show that a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments conducted across 13 NeRF architectures belonging to three families (MLPs, tri-planes, and, for the first time, hash tables), our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks involving multiple architectures, even unseen at training time, while also exceeding the results of existing frameworks limited to single architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: added third NeRF architecture.

In the semi-supervised few-shot learning setting, substantial quantities of unlabeled samples are available. Such unlabeled samples are generally cheaper to obtain and can be used to improve the few-shot learning performance of the model. Some of the recent methods for this setting rely on clustering to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled samples. Since the effectiveness of clustering heavily influences the labeling of the unlabeled samples, it can significantly affect the few-shot learning performance. In this paper, we focus on improving the representation learned by the model in order to improve the clustering and, consequently, the model performance. We propose an approach for semi-supervised few-shot learning that performs a class-variance optimized clustering coupled with a cluster separation tuner in order to improve the effectiveness of clustering the labeled and unlabeled samples in this setting. It also optimizes the clustering-based pseudo-labeling process using a restricted pseudo-labeling approach and performs semantic information injection in order to improve the semi-supervised few-shot learning performance of the model. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel, computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture (e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications.

| **[Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23529v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An AI System for Continuous Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Grading Using Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11500v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline.

| **[Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and User Preference Spaces for Multi-modal Music Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23298v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works of music representation learning mainly focus on learning acoustic music representations with unlabeled audios or further attempt to acquire multi-modal music representations with scarce annotated audio-text pairs. They either ignore the language semantics or rely on labeled audio datasets that are difficult and expensive to create. Moreover, merely modeling semantic space usually fails to achieve satisfactory performance on music recommendation tasks since the user preference space is ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Two-stage Contrastive Learning (HTCL) method that models similarity from the semantic perspective to the user perspective hierarchically to learn a comprehensive music representation bridging the gap between semantic and user preference spaces. We devise a scalable audio encoder and leverage a pre-trained BERT model as the text encoder to learn audio-text semantics via large-scale contrastive pre-training. Further, we explore a simple yet effective way to exploit interaction data from our online music platform to adapt the semantic space to user preference space via contrastive fine-tuning, which differs from previous works that follow the idea of collaborative filtering. As a result, we obtain a powerful audio encoder that not only distills language semantics from the text encoder but also models similarity in user preference space with the integrity of semantic space preserved. Experimental results on both music semantic and recommendation tasks confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | ICMR 2025 |
| **[Cross-Modal Causal Intervention for Medical Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09117v5)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is essential for computer-aided diagnosis and medication guidance, which can relieve the heavy burden of radiologists by automatically generating the corresponding radiology reports according to the given radiology image. However, generating accurate lesion descriptions remains challenging due to spurious correlations from visual-linguistic biases and inherent limitations of radiological imaging, such as low resolution and noise interference. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named CrossModal Causal Representation Learning (CMCRL), consisting of the Radiological Cross-modal Alignment and Reconstruction Enhanced (RadCARE) pre-training and the Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, RadCARE introduces a degradation-aware masked image restoration strategy tailored for radiological images, which reconstructs high-resolution patches from low-resolution inputs to mitigate noise and detail loss. Combined with a multiway architecture and four adaptive training strategies (e.g., text postfix generation with degraded images and text prefixes), RadCARE establishes robust cross-modal correlations even with incomplete data. In the VLCI phase, we deploy causal front-door intervention through two modules: the Visual Deconfounding Module (VDM) disentangles local-global features without fine-grained annotations, while the Linguistic Deconfounding Module (LDM) eliminates context bias without external terminology databases. Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR show that our CMCRL pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both stages.

| **[FreRA: A Frequency-Refined Augmentation for Contrastive Learning on Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23181v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Unfortunately, existing methods often struggle to balance efficiency and performance due to the complexity of feature modeling. Many of these existing approaches are constrained by rigid architectures and implicit representation learning, often characterized by parameter-heavy designs and a reliance on computationally intensive Vision Transformer-based frameworks. In this work, we introduce an efficient paradigm by synergizing explicit and implicit modeling to balance computational efficiency with representational fidelity. Our method combines well-defined Cartesian directions with explicitly modeled views and implicitly inferred intermediate representations, efficiently capturing global dependencies through a nested attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including ADE20K, CityScapes, Pascal Context, and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that LeMoRe strikes an effective balance between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICIP 2025</p></details> |

However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

The CLIP model is a widely adopted foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline. In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training. QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by up to 13.6 percent.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Improving Contrastive Learning for Referring Expression Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22850v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting has progressed from class-specific models, which count only known categories, to class-agnostic models that generalize to unseen categories. The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where the goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual differences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar objects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring expressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning framework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance discriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates entirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text contrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also guarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved robustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our framework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks like class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key components of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object centroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their success in counting tasks. We use this insight to design a simple yet effective detection-based baseline to build upon. Our experiments show that C-REX achieves state-of-the-art results in REC, outperforming previous methods by more than 22\% in MAE and more than 10\% in RMSE, while also demonstrating strong performance in class-agnostic counting.

Despite advancements in graph learning methods, challenges still remain in explainability when graphs are associated with semantic features. In this paper, we present GraphNarrator, the first method designed to generate natural language explanations for Graph Neural Networks. GraphNarrator employs a generative language model that maps input-output pairs to explanations reflecting the model's decision-making process. To address the lack of ground truth explanations to train the model, we propose first generating pseudo-labels that capture the model's decisions from saliency-based explanations, then using Expert Iteration to iteratively train the pseudo-label generator based on training objectives on explanation quality. The high-quality pseudo-labels are finally utilized to train an end-to-end explanation generator model. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphNarrator in producing faithful, concise, and human-preferred natural language explanations.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Main) |

For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while data may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often scarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to identify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by introducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to clinical features. This approach enables generalization to challenging clinical tasks featuring scarce training data. We achieve this by leveraging self-supervised learning on the control dataset to focus on inherent features that are not limited to a particular supervised task and incorporating meta-learning to improve the generalization across domains. To explore the generalizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical applications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring scarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification. Results demonstrate the superiority of our representation learning strategy on diverse clinically-relevant tasks.

| **[Understanding Representation Dynamics of Diffusion Models via Low-Dimensional Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05743v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, though originally designed for generative tasks, have demonstrated impressive self-supervised representation learning capabilities. A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably indicates generalization: it emerges when the model generalizes and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |

We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Neurodyne: Neural Pitch Manipulation with Representation Learning and Cycle-Consistency GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15368v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pitch manipulation is the process of producers adjusting the pitch of an audio segment to a specific key and intonation, which is essential in music production. Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing, heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance compared to standard GNNs on a variety of node-classification tasks, while also offering theoretical guarantees that demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ ACL 2025's Table Representation Learning Workshop (TRL)</p></details> |
| **[Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22202v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Transferability and Discriminability of Repersentation Learning in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22099v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary. Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD) to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in adversarial-based UDA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Analysis for Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL has remained limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate that the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to that class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 3 figures.

| **[VQ-CTAP: Cross-Modal Fine-Grained Sequence Representation Learning for Speech Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05758v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has brought significant improvements to the field of cross-modal representation learning. For tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), a cross-modal fine-grained (frame-level) sequence representation is desired, emphasizing the semantic content of the text modality while de-emphasizing the paralinguistic information of the speech modality. We propose a method called "Vector Quantized Contrastive Token-Acoustic Pre-training (VQ-CTAP)", which uses the cross-modal aligned sequence transcoder to bring text and speech into a joint multimodal space, learning how to connect text and speech at the frame level. The proposed VQ-CTAP is a paradigm for cross-modal sequence representation learning, offering a promising solution for fine-grained generation and recognition tasks in speech processing. The VQ-CTAP can be directly applied to VC and ASR tasks without fine-tuning or additional structures. We propose a sequence-aware semantic connector, which connects multiple frozen pre-trained modules for the TTS task, exhibiting a plug-and-play capability. We design a stepping optimization strategy to ensure effective model convergence by gradually injecting and adjusting the influence of various loss components. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-transfer-wise paralinguistic consistency loss to enhance representational capabilities, allowing the model to better generalize to unseen data and capture the nuances of paralinguistic information. In addition, VQ-CTAP achieves high-compression speech coding at a rate of 25Hz from 24kHz input waveforms, which is a 960-fold reduction in the sampling rate.

Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-source representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding. Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |

We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR. InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive <instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models, facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the instruction-following capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retri...</summary><p>Retrieval Models, Embedding, Retrieval with Instructions</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data, termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios.

Many knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) methods enhance the quality and credibility of LLMs by leveraging structure and semantic information in KGs as external knowledge bases. However, these methods struggle to effectively incorporate structure information, either incurring high computational costs or underutilizing available knowledge. Inspired by smoothing operations in graph representation learning, we propose path pooling, a simple, training-free strategy that introduces structure information through a novel path-centric pooling operation. It seamlessly integrates into existing KG-RAG methods in a plug-and-play manner, enabling richer structure information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating the path pooling into the state-of-the-art KG-RAG method consistently improves performance across various settings while introducing negligible additional cost.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we study predictors of the form $f(x)=\varphi^\star(\langle w^\star, x \rangle)$, where both the direction $w^\star \in \mathcal{S}_{d-1}$, the sphere of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the function $\varphi^\star: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are learned from Gaussian data. This setting captures a fundamental non-convex problem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear regression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating scheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information exponent reflecting the \textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function $\varphi^\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs even when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target. On the practical side, we demonstrate that such joint learning can be effectively implemented using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) adapted to the structure of the problem, enabling efficient and flexible estimation of the univariate function. Our results offer both theoretical insight and practical methodology for learning low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> | 31 Pages, 3 Figures |

However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a model named FlexiReg for urban region representation learning that is flexible with both the formation of urban regions and the input region features. FlexiReg is based on a spatial grid partitioning over the spatial area of interest. It learns representations for the grid cells, leveraging publicly accessible data, including POI, land use, satellite imagery, and street view imagery. We propose adaptive aggregation to fuse the cell representations and prompt learning techniques to tailor the representations towards different tasks, addressing the needs of varying formations of urban regions and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexiReg outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 202% in term of the accuracy of four diverse downstream tasks using the produced urban region representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at KDD 2025</p></details> |

This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then, we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks, outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a unique real-world case study for TDL.

| **[Generalizable and Robust Spectral Method for Multi-view Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02138v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view representation learning (MvRL) has garnered substantial attention in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for applications that can effectively process and analyze data from multiple sources. In this context, graph Laplacian-based MvRL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in representing multi-view data. However, these methods often struggle with generalization to new data and face challenges with scalability. Moreover, in many practical scenarios, multi-view data is contaminated by noise or outliers. In such cases, modern deep-learning-based MvRL approaches that rely on alignment or contrastive objectives present degraded performance in downstream tasks, as they may impose incorrect consistency between clear and corrupted data sources. We introduce $\textit{SpecRaGE}$, a novel fusion-based framework that integrates the strengths of graph Laplacian methods with the power of deep learning to overcome these challenges. SpecRage uses neural networks to learn parametric mapping that approximates a joint diagonalization of graph Laplacians. This solution bypasses the need for alignment while enabling generalizable and scalable learning of informative and meaningful representations. Moreover, it incorporates a meta-learning fusion module that dynamically adapts to data quality, ensuring robustness against outliers and noisy views. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecRaGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with data contamination, paving the way for more reliable and efficient multi-view learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Clustering via Targeted Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13690v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering traditionally aims to reveal a natural grouping structure within unlabeled data. However, this structure may not always align with users' preferences. In this paper, we propose a personalized clustering method that explicitly performs targeted representation learning by interacting with users via modicum task information (e.g., $\textit{must-link}$ or $\textit{cannot-link}$ pairs) to guide the clustering direction. We query users with the most informative pairs, i.e., those pairs most hard to cluster and those most easy to miscluster, to facilitate the representation learning in terms of the clustering preference. Moreover, by exploiting attention mechanism, the targeted representation is learned and augmented. By leveraging the targeted representation and constrained contrastive loss as well, personalized clustering is obtained. Theoretically, we verify that the risk of personalized clustering is tightly bounded, guaranteeing that active queries to users do mitigate the clustering risk. Experimentally, extensive results show that our method performs well across different clustering tasks and datasets, even when only a limited number of queries are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[The Third Pillar of Causal Analysis? A Measurement Perspective on Causal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17708v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis, often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Simple yet Effective Graph Distillation via Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20807v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite plentiful successes achieved by graph representation learning in various domains, the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) still remains tenaciously challenging due to the tremendous computational overhead needed for sizable graphs in practice. Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD. Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the paper "Simple yet Effective Graph Distillation via Clustering" accepted by KDD 2025</p></details> |

Such signals are completely unintelligible since the fundamental structures of phonemes and syllables are destroyed. However, they still retain tonal patterns that enable perceptual speaker identification despite losing linguistic content. In this paper, we propose leveraging speaker representations learned from time reversed speech as an augmentation strategy to enhance speaker representation. Notably, speaker and language disentanglement in voice conversion (VC) is essential to accurately preserve a speaker's unique vocal traits while minimizing interference from linguistic content. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of state-of-the-art diffusion-based VC models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves speaker similarity-related scores while maintaining high speech quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-supervised Clustering Through Representation Learning of Large-scale EHR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20731v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12128v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph based molecular representation learning is essential for accurately predicting molecular properties in drug discovery and materials science; however, it faces significant challenges due to the intricate relationships among molecules and the limited chemical knowledge utilized during training. While contrastive learning is often employed to handle molecular relationships, its reliance on binary metrics is insufficient for capturing the complexity of these interactions. Multimodal fusion has gained attention for property reasoning, but previous work has explored only a limited range of modalities, and the optimal stages for fusing different modalities in molecular property tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MMFRL (Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our method enhances embedding initialization through multimodal pretraining using relational learning. We also conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of modality fusion at different stages such as early, intermediate, and late, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that MMFRL significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, MMFRL enables task-specific optimizations. Additionally, the explainability of MMFRL provides valuable chemical insights, emphasizing its potential to enhance real-world drug discovery applications.</p></details> |  |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[HiPoNet: A Multi-View Simplicial Complex Network for High Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07746v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose HiPoNet, an end-to-end differentiable neural network for regression, classification, and representation learning on high-dimensional point clouds. Our work is motivated by single-cell data which can have very high-dimensionality --exceeding the capabilities of existing methods for point clouds which are mostly tailored for 3D data. Moreover, modern single-cell and spatial experiments now yield entire cohorts of datasets (i.e., one data set for every patient), necessitating models that can process large, high-dimensional point-clouds at scale. Most current approaches build a single nearest-neighbor graph, discarding important geometric and topological information. In contrast, HiPoNet models the point-cloud as a set of higher-order simplicial complexes, with each particular complex being created using a reweighting of features. This method thus generates multiple constructs corresponding to different views of high-dimensional data, which in biology offers the possibility of disentangling distinct cellular processes. It then employs simplicial wavelet transforms to extract multiscale features, capturing both local and global topology from each view. We show that geometric and topological information is preserved in this framework both theoretically and empirically. We showcase the utility of HiPoNet on point-cloud level tasks, involving classification and regression of entire point-clouds in data cohorts. Experimentally, we find that HiPoNet outperforms other point-cloud and graph-based models on single-cell data. We also apply HiPoNet to spatial transcriptomics datasets using spatial coordinates as one of the views. Overall, HiPoNet offers a robust and scalable solution for high-dimensional data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTaPEs: Visuotactile Position Encodings for Cross-Modal Alignment in Multimodal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20032v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective, rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen, out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting grasp success.

Demand prediction plays an important role in supporting planning, scheduling, fleet management, and other operational decisions. In this study, we propose an Origin-Destination (OD) demand prediction model called Multi-Graph Inductive Representation Learning (mGraphSAGE) for large-scale URT networks under operational uncertainties. Our main contributions are twofold: we enhance prediction results while ensuring scalability for large networks by relying simultaneously on multiple graphs, where each OD pair is a node on a graph and distinct OD relationships, such as temporal and spatial correlations; we show the importance of including operational uncertainties such as train delays and cancellations as inputs in demand prediction for daily operations. The model is validated on three different scales of the URT network in Copenhagen, Denmark. Experimental results show that by leveraging information from neighboring ODs and learning node representations via sampling and aggregation, mGraphSAGE is particularly suitable for OD demand prediction in large-scale URT networks, outperforming reference machine learning methods. Furthermore, during periods with train cancellations and delays, the performance gap between mGraphSAGE and other methods improves compared to normal operating conditions, demonstrating its ability to leverage system reliability information for predicting OD demand under uncertainty.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |

This is achieved without making any particular assumptions about the data type or other domain knowledge. The generality and domain agnosticism in combination with their simplicity make autoencoders a perfect sandbox for researching and developing novel (deep) clustering algorithms. Clustering methods group data based on similarity, a task that benefits from the lower-dimensional representation learned by an autoencoder, mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, the combination of deep learning with clustering, called Deep Clustering, enables to learn a representation tailored to specific clustering tasks, leading to high-quality results. This survey provides an introduction to fundamental autoencoder-based deep clustering algorithms that serve as building blocks for many modern approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://github.com/DeepAuto-AI/agentic-predictor</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific generation approaches.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE GlobeCom 2025</p></details> |

Domain Generalization (DG) methods overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation (DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features, they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods, which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing domain-randomization approaches.

While mixed-dataset training is widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy.

Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence, impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile, autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models (MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on 31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Singapore ports. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness to real-world challenges, making it adaptable to diverse maritime risk assessment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. We introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, languages, and embedding models confirmed QAEncoder's alignment capability, which offers a simple-yet-effective solution with zero additional index storage, retrieval latency, training costs, or catastrophic forgetting and hallucination issues.

While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training. However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure. Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes. However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult. Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process. To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information. Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents. The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

| **[A Generative Approach to Credit Prediction with Learnable Prompts for Multi-scale Temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13004v4)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent industrial credit scoring models remain heavily reliant on manually tuned statistical learning methods. While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Causal Complete Cause of Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14058v6)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause $C^3$. We begin by defining $C^3$, which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of $C^3$ and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying $C^3$ with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing $C^3$ risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformer via Split-Text Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19261v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs) inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions. One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.</p></details> | 21 pages |

We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe) approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach, playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by $3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.</p></details> |  |

Among various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity. Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning. Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2025</p></details> |

Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.</p></details> |  |

This bias is a major obstacle to creating equitable language technologies. We test whether the bias is driven by systematic differences in token-sampling uncertainty across six large language models. While we observe the presence of homogeneity bias using sentence similarity, we find very little difference in token sampling uncertainty across groups. This finding elucidates why temperature-based sampling adjustments fail to mitigate homogeneity bias. It suggests researchers should prioritize interventions targeting representation learning mechanisms and training corpus composition rather than inference-time output manipulations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, standard approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis. Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from sparse tokens.</p></details> | 10 pages, tokenizer |

Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision, dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias, particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation of rare user utterances and identify ASR errors. The second one is a domain-intent classification task, which aids the model in learning the representation of user sessions from long-tailed domains and improving the model's performance on such domains. The proposed method is evaluated on DuerOS, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of error recognition on rare user utterances and long-tailed domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://amazingren.github.io/MIRAGE/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ALl-i...</summary><p>ALl-in-One Image Restoration, low-level vision</p></details> |

Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins, the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously finding patterns in climate data.

Utilizing real-world data, we aim to learn the intent of a smart device user within confined areas of a vehicle's surroundings. However, in real-world scenarios, environmental factors and sensor limitations result in non-stationary and irregularly sampled data, posing significant challenges. To address these issues, we developed a Transformer-based approach, STaRFormer, which serves as a universal framework for sequential modeling. STaRFormer employs a novel, dynamic attention-based regional masking scheme combined with semi-supervised contrastive learning to enhance task-specific latent representations. Comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets varying in types (including non-stationary and irregularly sampled), domains, sequence lengths, training samples, and applications, demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of STaRFormer. We achieve notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing prototypical self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with more complex encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, code at https://github.com/sthalles/sop</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Boosting Open Set Recognition Performance through Modulated Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18137v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning.

Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not. However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to 63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, 27 pages, 20 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

It improves the feature space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large, high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation than existing hard negative mining strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning--commonly used in multi-task models--affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 17 main paper</p></details> |

In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Dynamic Graph Embedding through Hub-aware Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17764v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of high-degree nodes, or hubs, in shaping graph dynamics and structure is well-recognized in network science, yet their influence remains underexplored in the context of dynamic graph embedding. Recent advances in representation learning for graphs have shown that random walk-based methods can capture both structural and temporal patterns, but often overlook the impact of hubs on walk trajectories and embedding stability. In this paper, we introduce DeepHub, a method for dynamic graph embedding that explicitly integrates hub sensitivity into random walk sampling strategies. Focusing on dynnode2vec as a representative dynamic embedding method, we systematically analyze the effect of hub-biased walks across nine real-world temporal networks. Our findings reveal that standard random walks tend to overrepresent hub nodes, leading to embeddings that underfit the evolving local context of less-connected nodes. By contrast, hub-aware walks can balance exploration, resulting in embeddings that better preserve temporal neighborhood structure and improve downstream task performance. These results suggest that hub-awareness is an important yet overlooked factor in dynamic graph embedding, and our work provides a foundation for more robust, structure-sensitive representation learning in evolving networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

However, as a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding, fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation, particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained 3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning. Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 5 tablets; Submitted to BMVC2025</p></details> |

However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mechanism and a joint pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer is simultaneously optimized for molecule generation and property prediction, while exhibiting synergistic benefits in conditional sampling, out-of-distribution property prediction and representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of joint learning in a drug design use case of discovering novel antimicrobial~peptides.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multimodal Classification and Out-of-distribution Detection for Multimodal Intent Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12453v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal intent understanding is a significant research area that requires effective leveraging of multiple modalities to analyze human language. Existing methods face two main challenges in this domain. Firstly, they have limitations in capturing the nuanced and high-level semantics underlying complex in-distribution (ID) multimodal intents. Secondly, they exhibit poor generalization when confronted with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) data in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for both ID classification and OOD detection (MIntOOD). We first introduce a weighted feature fusion network that models multimodal representations. This network dynamically learns the importance of each modality, adapting to multimodal contexts. To develop discriminative representations for both tasks, we synthesize pseudo-OOD data from convex combinations of ID data and engage in multimodal representation learning from both coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives. The coarse-grained perspective focuses on distinguishing between ID and OOD binary classes, while the fine-grained perspective not only enhances the discrimination between different ID classes but also captures instance-level interactions between ID and OOD samples, promoting proximity among similar instances and separation from dissimilar ones. We establish baselines for three multimodal intent datasets and build an OOD benchmark. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves OOD detection performance with a 3~10% increase in AUROC scores while achieving new state-of-the-art results in ID classification. Data and codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/MIntOOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

The objective of sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements, application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Invariant Representation Learning by Distribution Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16126v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM), highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaSER: How Learning Can Guide the Evolution of Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17309v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolution and learning are two distinct yet complementary forms of adaptation. While evolutionary processes operate across generations via the selection of genotypes, learning occurs within the lifetime of an individual, shaping behavior through phenotypic adjustment. The Baldwin effect describes how lifetime learning can improve evolutionary search without altering inherited structures. While this has proven effective in areas like neuroevolution, where gradient-based learning is often used to fine-tune weights or behaviors produced by evolution, it remains underexplored in systems that evolve non-differentiable symbolic structures like Genetic Programming (GP). GP evolves explicit syntax trees that represent equations, offering strong interpretability but limited generalization due to the burden of discovering both useful representations and precise mappings. Here, we show for the first time that integrating a simple form of supervised learning, applied at the semantic or behavioral level during evaluation, can effectively guide the evolution of equations in GP. To achieve this, we propose a new GP pipeline, LaSER (Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression), where each GP individual generates a semantic representation that is passed to a supervised learner. The quality of the learned mapping is used to assign fitness, without modifying the underlying syntax tree or evolutionary process. Across standard symbolic regression benchmarks, in terms of generalization ability, LaSER significantly outperforms traditional GP and, in several cases, matches or exceeds popular machine learning regressors, while preserving the symbolic interpretability. By separating evolution from learning, LaSER offers a practical route to integrating GP with modern ML workflows, and opens new avenues for research at the intersection of evolutionary computation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on diverse datasets, including image data, we demonstrate that the proposed framework produces high-quality geodesics passing through the data support, reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, and provides a global chart of the manifold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable framework for extracting the complete geometry of the data manifold.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings. \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The dataset, source code, and trained models were released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional predictive coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Modeling and Optimization of Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23040v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification. However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore, despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer, 2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data. The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG) test metrics (AVG = 87.03\%) in HAM10000 dataset with multimodal learning, while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\% compared to swin\_b with 81.33\% in FL model. Furthermore, the use of support vector machine (SVM) can improve the overall test metrics with AVG of $\sim 2\%$ for swin transformer series in ISIC2018.

Transcriptomics provides interpretable, gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene expression representations with morphological information. To address data scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal representations for complex biological tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Learning Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19996v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging high-quality joint representations from multimodal data can greatly enhance model performance in various machine-learning based applications. Recent multimodal learning methods, based on the multimodal information bottleneck (MIB) principle, aim to generate optimal MIB with maximal task-relevant information and minimal superfluous information via regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound. OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency. Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark methods in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[ALAS: Measuring Latent Speech-Text Alignment For Spoken Language Understanding In Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19937v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon, named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity, and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion and resistance to missing modality.</p></details> |  |

However, vanilla fusion methods are limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level. First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way. Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios.

However, most current methods rely on proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks: description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility, structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein design.</p></details> |  |

However, modalities collected and curated during development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Online Federated Learning with Modality Missing in Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16138v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeCLIP: A Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained Spiking Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06488v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-granular body modeling with Redundancy-Free Spatiotemporal Fusion for Text-Driven Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06897v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-motion generation sits at the intersection of multimodal learning and computer graphics and is gaining momentum because it can simplify content creation for games, animation, robotics and virtual reality. Most current methods stack spatial and temporal features in a straightforward way, which adds redundancy and still misses subtle joint-level cues. We introduce HiSTF Mamba, a framework with three parts: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba and a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). The Dual-Spatial module runs part-based and whole-body models in parallel, capturing both overall coordination and fine-grained joint motion. The Bi-Temporal module scans sequences forward and backward to encode short-term details and long-term dependencies. DSFM removes redundant temporal information, extracts complementary cues and fuses them with spatial features to build a richer spatiotemporal representation. Experiments on the HumanML3D benchmark show that HiSTF Mamba performs well across several metrics, achieving high fidelity and tight semantic alignment between text and motion.</p></details> | 15pages,5figures, |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.</p></details> |  |

However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |

Although recent advances have improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering (JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts. Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers. We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figure |

In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Incorporating brain-inspired mechanisms for multimodal learning in artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10176v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches assume the availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.</p></details> |  |

In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets.

In this contribution, we identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 14pages |

Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead.

| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Aggregation of Dependent Expert Distributions in Multimodal Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01134v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Grounding for Efficient Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

| **[A multi-scale vision transformer-based multimodal GeoAI model for mapping Arctic permafrost thaw](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17822v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAP: Isolating Content from Style through Contrastive Learning with Augmented Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16445v6)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have garnered considerable attention for various downstream tasks, mainly due to the remarkable ability of the learned features for generalization. However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/airliisc/IndraEye.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR-W PBVS 2025</p></details> |

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |
| **[IoT-AMLHP: Aligned Multimodal Learning of Header-Payload Representations for Resource-Efficient Malicious IoT Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14833v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification is crucial for securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEFT A2Z: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Survey for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14117v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.</p></details> | PEFT Survey paper |

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |

Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Concept Modality Specific Datasets (CMSDs), which consist of data subsets categorized by the modality (visual, textual, or audio) of annotated concepts. Models trained on CMSDs outperform those using traditional legacy training in both early and late fusion approaches. Notably, this approach enables late fusion models to achieve performance close to that of early fusion models. These findings underscore the importance of modality-specific annotations in developing robust, self-explainable video models and contribute to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in complex video analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 Figures |

Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, submitted as a preprint.

In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> |

While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing minority and semantically similar emotions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |

While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

| **[Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18595v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance.

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data.

| **[Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning for Bridging Modality Gaps in Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14938v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification (FS-RSSC) presents the challenge of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning (OTAT) framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for advancing multimodal learning in remote sensing applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in FS-RSSC, significantly improving the model performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Welding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16537v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the performance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in skilled production work, with a focus on welding. Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

| **[Multimodal Foundation Models for Material Property Prediction and Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00111v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset and Model for Crop Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06973v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While conversational generative AI has shown considerable potential in enhancing decision-making for agricultural professionals, its exploration has predominantly been anchored in text-based interactions. The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications. The dataset is available at https: //github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CDDMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024 (14 pages, 8 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalization of Tactile Image Generation: Reference-Free Evaluation in a Leakage-Free Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06860v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing, which relies on direct physical contact, is critical for human perception and underpins applications in computer vision, robotics, and multimodal learning. Because tactile data is often scarce and costly to acquire, generating synthetic tactile images provides a scalable solution to augment real-world measurements. However, ensuring robust generalization in synthesizing tactile images-capturing subtle, material-specific contact features-remains challenging. We demonstrate that overlapping training and test samples in commonly used datasets inflate performance metrics, obscuring the true generalizability of tactile models. To address this, we propose a leakage-free evaluation protocol coupled with novel, reference-free metrics-TMMD, I-TMMD, CI-TMMD, and D-TMMD-tailored for tactile generation. Moreover, we propose a vision-to-touch generation method that leverages text as an intermediate modality by incorporating concise, material-specific descriptions during training to better capture essential tactile features. Experiments on two popular visuo-tactile datasets, Touch and Go and HCT, show that our approach achieves superior performance and enhanced generalization in a leakage-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17823v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 10 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Distribution Prediction: A Unified Approach to Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07090v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |
| **[DoPTA: Improving Document Layout Analysis using Patch-Text Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12902v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of multimodal learning has brought a significant improvement in document AI. Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating both textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in this space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as auxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based techniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text as input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning procedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique specially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to improve performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained with this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document image understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined with an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms larger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA also sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging document visual analysis benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GazeCLIP: Enhancing Gaze Estimation Through Text-Guided Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00260v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual gaze estimation, with its wide-ranging application scenarios, has garnered increasing attention within the research community. Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks. The implementation code and the pre-trained model will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

| **[BackdoorMBTI: A Backdoor Learning Multimodal Benchmark Tool Kit for Backdoor Defense Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11006v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented significant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert backdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.
