| **[GUI-G1: Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training for Visual Grounding in GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15810v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm, coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design, output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second, we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI agent grounding.

| **[The Agentic Economy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15799v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic opportunity.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-smith: Scaling Data for Software Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21798v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in Language Models (LMs) for software engineering, collecting training data remains a significant pain point. Existing datasets are small, with at most 1,000s of training instances from 11 or fewer GitHub repositories. The procedures to curate such datasets are often complex, necessitating hundreds of hours of human labor; companion execution environments also take up several terabytes of storage, severely limiting their scalability and usability. To address this pain point, we introduce SWE-smith, a novel pipeline for generating software engineering training data at scale. Given any Python codebase, SWE-smith constructs a corresponding execution environment, then automatically synthesizes 100s to 1,000s of task instances that break existing test(s) in the codebase. Using SWE-smith, we create a dataset of 50k instances sourced from 128 GitHub repositories, an order of magnitude larger than all previous works. We train SWE-agent-LM-32B, achieving 40.2% Pass@1 resolve rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, state of the art among open source models. We open source SWE-smith (collection procedure, task instances, trajectories, models) to lower the barrier of entry for research in LM systems for automated software engineering.

| **[Stay Focused: Problem Drift in Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19559v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent debate - multiple instances of large language models discussing problems in turn-based interaction - has shown promise for solving knowledge and reasoning tasks. However, these methods show limitations when solving complex problems that require longer reasoning chains. We analyze how multi-agent debate over multiple turns drifts away from the initial problem, thus harming task performance. We define this phenomenon as problem drift and quantify its presence across ten tasks (i.e., three generative, three knowledge, three reasoning, and one instruction-following task). To identify the reasons for this issue, eight human experts analyze 170 multi-agent discussions suffering from problem drift. We find the most common issues related to this drift are the lack of progress (35% of cases), low-quality feedback (26% of cases), and a lack of clarity (25% of cases). To address problem drift, we propose DRIFTJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge method, to detect problem drift at test-time. We also propose DRIFTPolicy, a method that mitigates problem drift cases to improve task performance. Our study is a step toward understanding a key limitation of multi-agent debate, highlighting why longer debates can harm task performance and how problem drift could be addressed.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02847v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/Tencent/digitalhuman/tree/main/SAGE</p></details> |
| **[Simulation Agent: A Framework for Integrating Simulation and Large Language Models for Enhanced Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13761v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulations, although powerful in accurately replicating real-world systems, often remain inaccessible to non-technical users due to their complexity. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) provide intuitive, language-based interactions but can lack the structured, causal understanding required to reliably model complex real-world dynamics. We introduce our simulation agent framework, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both simulation models and LLMs. This framework helps empower users by leveraging the conversational capabilities of LLMs to interact seamlessly with sophisticated simulation systems, while simultaneously utilizing the simulations to ground the LLMs in accurate and structured representations of real-world phenomena. This integrated approach helps provide a robust and generalizable foundation for empirical validation and offers broad applicability across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-WebAgentBench: A Multilingual Interactive Web Benchmark for Evaluating Global Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15372v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000 languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services. Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[OceanChat: The Effect of Virtual Conversational AI Agents on Sustainable Attitude and Behavior Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02863v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine ecosystems face unprecedented threats from climate change and plastic pollution, yet traditional environmental education often struggles to translate awareness into sustained behavioral change. This paper presents OceanChat, an interactive system leveraging large language models to create conversational AI agents represented as animated marine creatures -- specifically a beluga whale, a jellyfish, and a seahorse -- designed to promote environmental behavior (PEB) and foster awareness through personalized dialogue. Through a between-subjects experiment (N=900), we compared three conditions: (1) Static Scientific Information, providing conventional environmental education through text and images; (2) Static Character Narrative, featuring first-person storytelling from 3D-rendered marine creatures; and (3) Conversational Character Narrative, enabling real-time dialogue with AI-powered marine characters. Our analysis revealed that the Conversational Character Narrative condition significantly increased behavioral intentions and sustainable choice preferences compared to static approaches. The beluga whale character demonstrated consistently stronger emotional engagement across multiple measures, including perceived anthropomorphism and empathy. However, impacts on deeper measures like climate policy support and psychological distance were limited, highlighting the complexity of shifting entrenched beliefs. Our work extends research on sustainability interfaces facilitating PEB and offers design principles for creating emotionally resonant, context-aware AI characters. By balancing anthropomorphism with species authenticity, OceanChat demonstrates how interactive narratives can bridge the gap between environmental knowledge and real-world behavior change.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Weaks Win Single Strong: Large Language Models Ensemble Weak Reinforcement Learning Agents into a Supreme One](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15306v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility, our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4RLensemble-F7EE.</p></details> |  |

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[BountyBench: Dollar Impact of AI Agent Attackers and Defenders on Real-World Cybersecurity Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15216v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit (exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages, setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch, mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of 40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.</p></details> | 78 pages |
| **[ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15182v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.</p></details> |  |

The agent's primary task is identifying the screen coordinates of the UI element corresponding to the user's command. It demonstrates very strong performance on Screenspot and OmniAct annotations, while maintaining a very small size of 0.27B parameters and minimal latency. Moreover, training needs small compute budget of 56 GPU-hours (worth about 40 USD). Relevant improvement comes from vision-specific multi-task training and MLLM-based data augmentation. We hope that decreased needs for expensive compute resources and manually annotated data will allow to facilitate more inclusive and sustainable research of UI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[R&D-Agent-Quant: A Multi-Agent Framework for Data-Centric Factors and Model Joint Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15155v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are AI Agents interacting with Online Ads?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07112v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI-driven agents become increasingly integrated into the digital ecosystem, they reshape how online advertising is perceived and processed. Particularly in the travel and hotel booking sector, these autonomous systems influence the effectiveness of traditional advertising formats. While visual cues and emotional appeals sway human users, AI agents prioritize structured data such as price, availability, and specifications. This study examines how different AI agents interact with online advertising, whether they incorporate ads into their decision-making processes, and which ad formats prove most effective. We analyze interaction patterns, click behavior, and decision-making strategies through experiments with multimodal language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our findings reveal that AI agents neither ignore nor systematically avoid advertisements but instead favor certain features-particularly keywords and structured data. These insights have significant implications for the future design of advertising strategies in AI-dominated digital environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |
| **[A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110v7)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning-Search Interleaved LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15117v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use. While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized) significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[A Risk Taxonomy for Evaluating AI-Powered Psychotherapy Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15108v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide, facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in the domain of AI-driven mental health support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence of human-like polarization among large language model agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05171v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have not only empowered autonomous agents to generate social networks, communicate, and form shared and diverging opinions on political issues, but have also begun to play a growing role in shaping human political deliberation. Our understanding of their collective behaviours and underlying mechanisms remains incomplete, however, posing unexpected risks to human society. In this paper, we simulate a networked system involving thousands of large language model agents, discovering their social interactions, guided through LLM conversation, result in human-like polarization. We discover that these agents spontaneously develop their own social network with human-like properties, including homophilic clustering, but also shape their collective opinions through mechanisms observed in the real world, including the echo chamber effect. Similarities between humans and LLM agents -- encompassing behaviours, mechanisms, and emergent phenomena -- raise concerns about their capacity to amplify societal polarization, but also hold the potential to serve as a valuable testbed for identifying plausible strategies to mitigate polarization and its consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Feature Augmentation: Unifying Selection and Generation with Teaming, Planning, and Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15076v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions. To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating feature selection and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PiFlow: Principle-aware Scientific Discovery with Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15047v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/PiFlow}{GitHub}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Design Matters: A Self-Design Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14996v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design. SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.</p></details> |  |

These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages. 5 figures. AAAI 2025 MARW Best Paper Award</p></details> |

By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains.

Currently, AI remains effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively "experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel, perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital "metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Aarhus 2025 Conference</p></details> |

This is exacerbated by the growing number of individuals struggling with cognitive decline and shrinking number of youth who provide care for them. Artificially intelligent agents could provide cognitive support to older adults experiencing memory problems, and they could help informal caregivers with coordination tasks. To better understand this possible future, we conducted a speed dating with storyboards study to reveal invisible social boundaries that might keep older adults and their caregivers from accepting and using agents. We found that healthy older adults worry that accepting agents into their homes might increase their chances of developing dementia. At the same time, they want immediate access to agents that know them well if they should experience cognitive decline. Older adults in the early stages of cognitive decline expressed a desire for agents that can ease the burden they saw themselves becoming for their caregivers. They also speculated that an agent who really knew them well might be an effective advocate for their needs when they were less able to advocate for themselves. That is, the agent may need to transition from being unremarkable to remarkable. Based on these findings, we present design opportunities and considerations for agents and articulate directions of future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW)</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Autonomous VLM Agents via Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07949v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) methods have enabled vision-language model (VLM) agents to learn from interaction with online environments without human supervision. However, these methods often struggle with learning inefficiencies when applied to complex, real-world decision-making tasks with sparse rewards and long-horizon dependencies. We propose a novel framework, Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (VSC-RL), advancing the VLM agents in resolving challenging decision-making tasks. Fundamentally distinct from existing methods, VSC-RL reformulates the decision-making problem as a variational subgoal-conditioned RL problem with the newly derived optimization objective, Subgoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which comprises two key components: (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return, and (b) minimizing the divergence from a reference goal-conditioned policy. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the VSC-RL can efficiently improve the learning efficiency without compromising performance guarantees. Across a diverse set of challenging benchmarks, including mobile device and web control tasks, VSC-RL consistently outperforms existing SOTA methods, achieving superior learning efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  |

MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction. Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextAgent: Context-Aware Proactive LLM Agents with Open-World Sensory Perceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14668v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Context Protocols Enhance Collective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14569v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding, reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents. We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii) standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Initial Introduction to Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06161v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. While numerous approaches have been developed, they can be broadly categorized into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and decentralized training and execution (DTE). CTE methods assume centralization during training and execution (e.g., with fast, free, and perfect communication) and have the most information during execution. CTDE methods are the most common, as they leverage centralized information during training while enabling decentralized execution -- using only information available to that agent during execution. Decentralized training and execution methods make the fewest assumptions and are often simple to implement. This text is an introduction to cooperative MARL -- MARL in which all agents share a single, joint reward. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods for the CTE, CTDE, and DTE settings. It does not cover all work in cooperative MARL as the area is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the area and apologize to those that I have omitted. Topics include simple applications of single-agent methods to CTE as well as some more scalable methods that exploit the multi-agent structure, independent Q-learning and policy gradient methods and their extensions, as well as value function factorization methods including the well-known VDN, QMIX, and QPLEX approaches, and centralized critic methods including MADDPG, COMA, and MAPPO. I also discuss common misconceptions, the relationship between different approaches, and some open questions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider Byzantine agents that inject stealthy attacks to degrade the performance of the DGD algorithm in terms of its optimal value. To mitigate the effect of stealthy attacks, some agents are allocated to monitor the evolution of their gradient. We then propose a method to quantify the maximum deviation caused by the Byzantine agent in the optimal value of the DGD. Our approach serves as a security metric to evaluate the robustness of graph structures against Byzantine attacks. We validate our findings through numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability, and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we first propose a general framework for exploring multi-agent information diffusion. We identified LLMs' deficiency in the perception and utilization of social relationships, as well as diverse actions. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of the LLM attention mechanism. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we explore the information diffusion features in the asymmetric open environment by observing the evolution of information gaps, diffusion patterns, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ai-agents-2030.github.io/ViMo/</p></details> |

Though effective in mathematical problem-solving, MLLMs often struggle with the nuanced task of identifying and categorizing student errors in multimodal mathematical contexts. Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL Industry 2025, Oral Presentation)</p></details> |

Current approaches condense complex procedural workflows into a single agent to achieve satisfactory performance on large-scale LLMs. However, these approaches face challenges to achieve comparable performance on fine-tuned lightweight LLMs, due to their limited capabilities in handling multiple complex logic. In this work, we design a Domain-Independent Multi-Agent Framework (DIMF), which contains Intent Classification Agent, Slot Filling Agent and Response Agent. This approach simplifies the learning complexity and enhances the generalization ability by separating the tasks into domain-independent components. In this framework, we enhance the capabilities in contextual understanding using the Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) method, and propose a simple and effective Data Distribution Adaptation (DDA) method to mitigate degradation issues during DPO training. Experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ datasets show that our proposed method achieves a better average performance among all the baselines. Extensive analysis also demonstrates that our proposed framework exhibits excellent generalizability and zero-shot capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVA: Red-Teaming GUI Agents via Evolving Indirect Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14289v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages, and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response. Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models, revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal decision making.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multi-observer framework for personality trait assessments in LLM agents that draws on informant-report methods in psychology. Instead of relying on self-assessments, we employ multiple observer agents. Each observer is configured with a specific relational context (e.g., family member, friend, or coworker) and engages the subject LLM in dialogue before evaluating its behavior across the Big Five dimensions. We show that these observer-report ratings align more closely with human judgments than traditional self-reports and reveal systematic biases in LLM self-assessments. We also found that aggregating responses from 5 to 7 observers reduces systematic biases and achieves optimal reliability. Our results highlight the role of relationship context in perceiving personality and demonstrate that a multi-observer paradigm offers a more reliable, context-sensitive approach to evaluating LLM personality traits.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing approaches have successfully demonstrated slide editing via graphic user interface (GUI)-based agents, offering intuitive visual control. However, such methods often suffer from high computational cost and latency. In this paper, we propose Talk-to-Your-Slides, an LLM-powered agent designed to edit slides %in active PowerPoint sessions by leveraging structured information about slide objects rather than relying on image modality. The key insight of our work is designing the editing process with distinct high-level and low-level layers to facilitate interaction between user commands and slide objects. By providing direct access to application objects rather than screen pixels, our system enables 34.02% faster processing, 34.76% better instruction fidelity, and 87.42% cheaper operation than baselines. To evaluate slide editing capabilities, we introduce TSBench, a human-annotated dataset comprising 379 diverse editing instructions paired with corresponding slide variations in four categories.

This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and memoryless policies are sufficient for approximating an arbitrary frequency vector achievable by a general (infinite-memory) policy. We study the steady-state synthesis problem for multiagent systems, where multiple autonomous agents jointly strive to achieve a suitable frequency vector. We show that the problem for multiple agents is computationally hard (PSPACE or NP hard, depending on the variant), and memoryless strategy profiles are insufficient for approximating achievable frequency vectors. Furthermore, we prove that even evaluating the frequency vector achieved by a given memoryless profile is computationally hard. This reveals a severe barrier to constructing an efficient synthesis algorithm, even for memoryless profiles. Nevertheless, we design an efficient and scalable synthesis algorithm for a subclass of full memoryless profiles, and we evaluate this algorithm on a large class of randomly generated instances. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement against a naive algorithm based on strategy sharing.</p></details> |  |

In the open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration, the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT) with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs' agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and +10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building robust and generalizable multimodal agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project url: https://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT/tree/main/Visual-ARFT</p></details> |
| **[IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12442v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, existing token-based world models (TBWMs) are limited to visual inputs and discrete actions, restricting their adoption and applicability. Moreover, although both intrinsic motivation and prioritized WM replay have shown promise in improving WM performance and generalization, they remain underexplored in this setting, particularly in combination. We introduce Simulus, a highly modular TBWM agent that integrates (1) a modular multi-modality tokenization framework, (2) intrinsic motivation, (3) prioritized WM replay, and (4) regression-as-classification for reward and return prediction. Simulus achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency for planning-free WMs across three diverse benchmarks.

However, existing frameworks still suffer two practical drawbacks: they must be re-tuned whenever the KG or reasoning task changes, and they depend on a single, high-capacity LLM for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, we introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability with reduced inference cost but increased abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning, reducing reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference.

| **[Safety Devolution in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14215v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As retrieval-augmented AI agents become more embedded in society, their safety properties and ethical behavior remain insufficiently understood. In particular, the growing integration of LLMs and AI agents raises critical questions about how they engage with and are influenced by their environments. This study investigates how expanding retrieval access, from no external sources to Wikipedia-based retrieval and open web search, affects model reliability, bias propagation, and harmful content generation. Through extensive benchmarking of censored and uncensored LLMs and AI Agents, our findings reveal a consistent degradation in refusal rates, bias sensitivity, and harmfulness safeguards as models gain broader access to external sources, culminating in a phenomenon we term safety devolution. Notably, retrieval-augmented agents built on aligned LLMs often behave more unsafely than uncensored models without retrieval. This effect persists even under strong retrieval accuracy and prompt-based mitigation, suggesting that the mere presence of retrieved content reshapes model behavior in structurally unsafe ways. These findings underscore the need for robust mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and reliability in retrieval-augmented and increasingly autonomous AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies primarily focus on enhancing in-context learning through improved search, sampling, and planning techniques, while overlooking the importance of the order in which problems are tackled during inference. In this work, we develop a novel inference-time optimization framework, referred to as DSMentor, which leverages curriculum learning -- a strategy that introduces simpler task first and progressively moves to more complex ones as the learner improves -- to enhance LLM agent performance in challenging data science tasks. Our mentor-guided framework organizes data science tasks in order of increasing difficulty and incorporates a growing long-term memory to retain prior experiences, guiding the agent's learning progression and enabling more effective utilization of accumulated knowledge. We evaluate DSMentor through extensive experiments on DSEval and QRData benchmarks. Experiments show that DSMentor using Claude-3.5-Sonnet improves the pass rate by up to 5.2% on DSEval and QRData compared to baseline agents. Furthermore, DSMentor demonstrates stronger causal reasoning ability, improving the pass rate by 8.8% on the causality problems compared to GPT-4 using Program-of-Thoughts prompts. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for accumulating and utilizing knowledge during inference, mirroring the human learning process and opening new avenues for improving LLM performance through curriculum-based inference optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Thinking via Mode Policy Optimization for Social Language Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02156v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current studies. Existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning uniformly across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inflexible social simulation. To address this, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) framework in this paper, aiming to improve the adaptive thinking ability of language agents in dynamic social interactions. To this end, we first identify hierarchical thinking modes ranging from intuitive response to deep deliberation based on the cognitive control theory. We then develop the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm to optimize the context-aware mode switching and reasoning. Our framework advances existing research in three key aspects: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence benchmarks verify that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o. Notably, our AMPO outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains, demonstrating the advantage of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization mechanism in AMPO over GRPO's fixed-depth solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

Unlike mathematical reasoning, which assumes a predefined formulation, modeling requires open-ended problem analysis, abstraction, and principled formalization. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, they fall short in rigorous model construction, limiting their utility in real-world problem-solving. To this end, we formalize the task of LLM-powered real-world mathematical modeling, where agents must analyze problems, construct domain-appropriate formulations, and generate complete end-to-end solutions. We introduce MM-Bench, a curated benchmark of 111 problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), spanning the years 2000 to 2025 and across ten diverse domains such as physics, biology, and economics. To tackle this task, we propose MM-Agent, an expert-inspired framework that decomposes mathematical modeling into four stages: open-ended problem analysis, structured model formulation, computational problem solving, and report generation. Experiments on MM-Bench show that MM-Agent significantly outperforms baseline agents, achieving an 11.88\% improvement over human expert solutions while requiring only 15 minutes and \$0.88 per task using GPT-4o. Furthermore, under official MCM/ICM protocols, MM-Agent assisted two undergraduate teams in winning the Finalist Award (\textbf{top 2.0\% among 27,456 teams}) in MCM/ICM 2025, demonstrating its practical effectiveness as a modeling copilot.

Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building a Stable Planner: An Extended Finite State Machine Based Planning Module for Mobile GUI Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14141v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents execute user commands by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) of mobile devices, demonstrating significant potential to enhance user convenience. However, these agents face considerable challenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and generate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners' learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans, enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus promoting the sustainable development of education.</p></details> | <details><summary>In CG...</summary><p>In CGI 2025: 42nd Computer Graphics International Conference, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peper No. 134</p></details> |
| **[Iterative Tool Usage Exploration for Multimodal Agents via Step-wise Preference Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21561v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller e.g., a vision language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Existing approaches for training these agents, both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, depend on extensive human-annotated task-answer pairs and tool trajectories. However, for complex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or impractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage exploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool usage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective tool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating the bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first synthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel trajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent tries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification, we employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage through preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks shows that the SPORT agent achieves 6.41% and 3.64% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

| **[Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-2025).

| **[BAR: A Backward Reasoning based Agent for Complex Minecraft Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14079v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent (BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust, consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods and the effectiveness of proposed modules.</p></details> |  |

Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency. We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process vs. Outcome Reward: Which is Better for Agentic RAG Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14069v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge and up-to-date information. However, traditional RAG systems are limited by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. To address these limitations, agentic RAG systems (e.g., DeepResearch) have been proposed, enabling dynamic retrieval strategies, iterative context refinement, and adaptive workflows for handling complex search queries beyond the capabilities of conventional RAG. Recent advances, such as Search-R1, have demonstrated promising gains using outcome-based reinforcement learning, where the correctness of the final answer serves as the reward signal. Nevertheless, such outcome-supervised agentic RAG methods face challenges including low exploration efficiency, gradient conflict, and sparse reward signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose to utilize fine-grained, process-level rewards to improve training stability, reduce computational costs, and enhance efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel method ReasonRAG that automatically constructs RAG-ProGuide, a high-quality dataset providing process-level rewards for (i) query generation, (ii) evidence extraction, and (iii) answer generation, thereby enhancing model inherent capabilities via process-supervised reinforcement learning. With the process-level policy optimization, the proposed framework empowers LLMs to autonomously invoke search, generate queries, extract relevant evidence, and produce final answers. Compared to existing approaches such as Search-R1 and traditional RAG systems, ReasonRAG, leveraging RAG-ProGuide, achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets using only 5k training instances, significantly fewer than the 90k training instances required by Search-R1.</p></details> |  |

This problem is commonly formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) known as the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP). Existing solvers for this problem primarily rely on either linear programming, which provides accurate solutions but requires computation times that grow with the size of the problem, or heuristic methods, which typically find suboptimal solutions in a shorter time. In this paper, we introduce TOP-Former, a multi-agent route planning neural network designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Team Orienteering Problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a centralized Transformer neural network capable of learning to encode the scenario (modeled as a graph) and analyze the complete context of all agents to deliver fast, precise, and collaborative solutions. Unlike other neural network-based approaches that adopt a more local perspective, TOP-Former is trained to understand the global situation of the vehicle fleet and generate solutions that maximize long-term expected returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented system outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> |  |

Training these agents requires large-scale high-quality data, which is prohibitively expensive when relying on human labor. Given the vast population of global mobile phone users, if automated data collection from them becomes feasible, the resulting data volume and the subsequently trained mobile agents could reach unprecedented levels. Nevertheless, two major challenges arise: (1) extracting user instructions without human intervention and (2) utilizing distributed user data while preserving privacy. To tackle these challenges, we propose MobileA3gent, a collaborative framework that trains mobile GUI Agents using decentralized self-sourced data from diverse users. The framework comprises two components, each targeting a specific challenge: (1) Auto-Annotation, which enables the automatic collection of high-quality datasets during users' routine phone usage with minimal cost. (2) FedVLM-A, which enhances federated VLM training under non-IID distributions by incorporating adapted global aggregation based on both episode-level and step-level variability. Extensive experiments prove that MobileA3gent achieves superior performance over traditional approaches at only 1% of the cost, highlighting its potential for real-world applications</p></details> |  |

However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

While humans instinctively align their communication with mental states -- an ability known as Theory of Mind (ToM), current LLM powered systems exhibit significant limitations in this regard. This study examines the extent to which open source language models (LLaMA) can capture and preserve ToM related information and how effectively it contributes to consistent ToM reasoning in generated responses. We further investigate whether explicit manipulation of ToM related components, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, can enhance response alignment. Experiments on two LLaMA 3 variants demonstrate that incorporating ToM informed alignment improves response quality, achieving win rates of 67 and 63 percent for the 3B and 8B models, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of ToM driven strategies to improve alignment in LLM based conversational agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

However, traditional AES methods struggle with evaluation generalizability and multimodal perception, while even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches can produce hallucinated justifications and scores misaligned with human judgment. To address the limitations, we introduce CAFES, the first collaborative multi-agent framework specifically designed for AES. It orchestrates three specialized agents: an Initial Scorer for rapid, trait-specific evaluations; a Feedback Pool Manager to aggregate detailed, evidence-grounded strengths; and a Reflective Scorer that iteratively refines scores based on this feedback to enhance human alignment. Extensive experiments, using state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieve an average relative improvement of 21% in Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) against ground truth, especially for grammatical and lexical diversity. Our proposed CAFES framework paves the way for an intelligent multimodal AES system.

However, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating agent safety presents a significant barrier to effective assessment and further improvement. In this paper, we introduce Agent-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LLM agents. Agent-SafetyBench encompasses 349 interaction environments and 2,000 test cases, evaluating 8 categories of safety risks and covering 10 common failure modes frequently encountered in unsafe interactions. Our evaluation of 16 popular LLM agents reveals a concerning result: none of the agents achieves a safety score above 60%. This highlights significant safety challenges in LLM agents and underscores the considerable need for improvement. Through failure mode and helpfulness analysis, we summarize two fundamental safety defects in current LLM agents: lack of robustness and lack of risk awareness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that reliance on defense prompts alone may be insufficient to address these safety issues, emphasizing the need for more advanced and robust strategies. To drive progress in this area, Agent-SafetyBench has been released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Agent-SafetyBench/ to facilitate further research in agent safety evaluation and improvement.</p></details> | 26 pages |

We introduce MLZero, a novel multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even with a compact 8B LLM, outperforming full-size systems from existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, in the field of drug discovery, despite the optimization through professional data pre-training, context window expansion, and internet search, the existing LLMs are still facing challenges such as massive multi-modal and heterogeneous data processing, domain knowledge dynamic updating delay, and insufficient confidence in predicting the results of complex computational tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the DrugPilot, an LLM-based agent with parameterized reasoning for drug discovery. DrugPilot addresses key limitations of traditional end-to-end LLM prediction approaches through its parametric inference architecture. This agent system supports major phases of the drug discovery pipeline, facilitating automated planning and execution of multi-stage research tasks. To address the critical challenge of multi-modal drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations, simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission. Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset, outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT).

However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety.

We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision Support System, Agentic-AI Applications</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

We introduce PC Agent-E, an efficient agent training framework that significantly reduces reliance on large-scale human demonstrations. Starting with just 312 human-annotated computer use trajectories, we further improved data quality by synthesizing diverse action decisions with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Trained on these enriched trajectories, our PC Agent-E model achieved a remarkable 141% relative improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on WindowsAgentArena-V2, an improved benchmark we also released. Furthermore, PC Agent-E demonstrates strong generalizability to different operating systems on OSWorld. Our findings suggest that strong computer use capabilities can be stimulated from a small amount of high-quality trajectory data.</p></details> | <details><summary>We op...</summary><p>We open-source our entire suite of code, data, and models to facilitate future research at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/PC-Agent-E</p></details> |
| **[A Challenge to Build Neuro-Symbolic Video Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13851v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making. Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing the boundaries of video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLAYER*: Enhancing LLM-based Multi-Agent Communication and Interaction in Murder Mystery Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17662v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WellPlay, a reasoning dataset for multi-agent conversational inference in Murder Mystery Games (MMGs). WellPlay comprises 1,482 inferential questions across 12 games, spanning objectives, reasoning, and relationship understanding, and establishes a systematic benchmark for evaluating agent reasoning abilities in complex social settings. Building on this foundation, we present PLAYER*, a novel framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in MMGs. MMGs pose unique challenges, including undefined state spaces, absent intermediate rewards, and the need for strategic reasoning through natural language. PLAYER* addresses these challenges with a sensor-based state representation and an information-driven strategy that optimises questioning and suspect pruning. Experiments show that PLAYER* outperforms existing methods in reasoning accuracy, efficiency, and agent-human interaction, advancing reasoning agents for complex social scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Agent Distillation for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13820v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into {[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Alpha in Finance Harnessing Human Insight and LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14727v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of alpha returns that exceed market benchmarks has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from intuition-driven investing to autonomous, AI powered systems. This paper introduces a comprehensive five stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies, statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic architectures powered by large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior surveys focused narrowly on modeling techniques, this review adopts a system level lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion, and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonaGym: Evaluating Persona Agents and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18416v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persona agents, which are LLM agents conditioned to act according to an assigned persona, enable contextually rich and user aligned interactions across domains like education and healthcare. However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Building reliable sim driving agents by scaling self-play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14706v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation agents are essential for designing and testing systems that interact with humans, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). These agents serve various purposes, from benchmarking AV performance to stress-testing system limits, but all applications share one key requirement: reliability. To enable sound experimentation, a simulation agent must behave as intended. It should minimize actions that may lead to undesired outcomes, such as collisions, which can distort the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses. As a foundation for reliable sim agents, we propose scaling self-play to thousands of scenarios on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset under semi-realistic limits on human perception and control. Training from scratch on a single GPU, our agents solve almost the full training set within a day. They generalize to unseen test scenes, achieving a 99.8% goal completion rate with less than 0.8% combined collision and off-road incidents across 10,000 held-out scenarios. Beyond in-distribution generalization, our agents show partial robustness to out-of-distribution scenes and can be fine-tuned in minutes to reach near-perfect performance in such cases. We open-source the pre-trained agents and integrate them with a batched multi-agent simulator. Demonstrations of agent behaviors can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/reliable-sim-agents, and we open-source our agents at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/gpudrive.</p></details> | v3 |
| **[TheAgentCompany: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Consequential Real World Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14161v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Distributed Model Predictive Control Design for Multi-agent Systems via Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12989v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new approach that leverages Multi-agent Bayesian Optimization (MABO) to design Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) schemes for multi-agent systems. The primary objective is to learn optimal DMPC schemes even when local model predictive controllers rely on imperfect local models. The proposed method invokes a dual decomposition-based distributed optimization framework, incorporating an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based MABO algorithm to enable coordinated learning of parameterized DMPC schemes. This enhances the closed-loop performance of local controllers, despite discrepancies between their models and the actual multi-agent system dynamics. In addition to the newly proposed algorithms, this work also provides rigorous proofs establishing the optimality and convergence of the underlying learning method. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MABO-based learning approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAFA: A multi-agent framework for annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13668v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems. Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our framework features a specialized few-shot example strategy, where each agent receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world banking dataset as well as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a 14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public benchmarks when compared with traditional single agent annotation techniques. Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making it well-suited for deployment in production applications while showing strong generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Search Strategies in Non-Serializable Environments with Applications to Software Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13652v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in complex multi-step tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and agentic software engineering. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance across multiple solution attempts. One effective approach to narrow the gap between average-case and best-case performance is guided test-time search, which explores multiple solution paths to identify the most promising one. Unfortunately, effective search techniques (e.g. MCTS) are often unsuitable for non-serializable RL environments, such as Docker containers, where intermediate environment states cannot be easily saved and restored. We investigate two complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new state-of-the-art for open-weights models. Additionally, we show that these techniques are transferable to more advanced closed models, yielding similar improvements with GPT-4o.</p></details> | ICML |
| **[Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment, which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesis of Communication Policies for Multi-Agent Systems Robust to Communication Restrictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13311v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study stochastic multi-agent systems in which agents must cooperate to maximize the probability of achieving a common reach-avoid objective. In many applications, during the execution of the system, the communication between the agents can be constrained by restrictions on the bandwidth currently available for exchanging local-state information between the agents. In this paper, we propose a method for computing joint action and communication policies for the group of agents that aim to satisfy the communication restrictions as much as possible while achieving the optimal reach-avoid probability when communication is unconstrained. Our method synthesizes a pair of action and communication policies robust to restrictions on the number of agents allowed to communicate. To this end, we introduce a novel cost function that measures the amount of information exchanged beyond what the communication policy allows. We evaluate our approach experimentally on a range of benchmarks and demonstrate that it is capable of computing pairs of action and communication policies that satisfy the communication restrictions, if such exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[AXIS: Efficient Human-Agent-Computer Interaction with API-First LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to directly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents' performance in complex tasks. However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework that prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Microsoft Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compared to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and explores a fresh UI design principle for application providers to turn applications into agents in the era of LLMs, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code, and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications, our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation. We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open ...</summary><p>Open source code available at https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/TimeSeriesGym.

| **[Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source codes are available at https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/ConsensusDiversityTradeoffMAS</p></details> |

Previous benchmarks and environments, such as Melting Pot, provide an evaluation protocol that measures generalization to new social partners in various test scenarios. However, running reinforcement learning algorithms in traditional environments requires substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce SocialJax, a suite of sequential social dilemma environments and algorithms implemented in JAX. JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library for Python that enables significant improvements in operational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialJax training pipeline achieves at least 50\texttimes{} speed-up in real-time performance compared to Melting Pot RLlib baselines. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of baseline algorithms within SocialJax environments. Finally, we use Schelling diagrams to verify the social dilemma properties of these environments, ensuring that they accurately capture the dynamics of social dilemmas.</p></details> |  |

We propose "Agentic Publications", a novel LLM-driven framework complementing traditional publishing by transforming papers into interactive knowledge systems. Our architecture integrates structured data with unstructured content through retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent verification. The framework offers interfaces for both humans and machines, combining narrative explanations with machine-readable outputs while addressing ethical considerations through automated validation and transparent governance. Key features include continuous knowledge updates, automatic integration of new findings, and customizable detail levels. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates multilingual interaction, API accessibility, and structured knowledge representation through vector databases, knowledge graphs, and verification agents. This approach enhances scientific communication across disciplines, improving efficiency and collaboration while preserving traditional publishing pathways, particularly valuable for interdisciplinary fields where knowledge integration remains challenging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17061v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 72.2\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.</p></details> | In submission |
| **[TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08638v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/TRAIL</p></details> |
| **[When a Reinforcement Learning Agent Encounters Unknown Unknowns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13188v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An AI agent might surprisingly find she has reached an unknown state which she has never been aware of -- an unknown unknown. We mathematically ground this scenario in reinforcement learning: an agent, after taking an action calculated from value functions $Q$ and $V$ defined on the {\it {aware domain}}, reaches a state out of the domain. To enable the agent to handle this scenario, we propose an {\it episodic Markov decision {process} with growing awareness} (EMDP-GA) model, taking a new {\it noninformative value expansion} (NIVE) approach to expand value functions to newly aware areas: when an agent arrives at an unknown unknown, value functions $Q$ and $V$ whereon are initialised by noninformative beliefs -- the averaged values on the aware domain. This design is out of respect for the complete absence of knowledge in the newly discovered state. The upper confidence bound momentum Q-learning is then adapted to the growing awareness for training the EMDP-GA model. We prove that (1) the regret of our approach is asymptotically consistent with the state of the art (SOTA) without exposure to unknown unknowns in an extremely uncertain environment, and (2) our computational complexity and space complexity are comparable with the SOTA -- these collectively suggest that though an unknown unknown is surprising, it will be asymptotically properly discovered with decent speed and an affordable cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Table-Critic: A Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Criticism and Refinement in Table Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11799v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

However, their reliance on dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept exploit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Performing Autonomous Stock Trading under Good and Bad Situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03985v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock trading is one of the popular ways for financial management. However, the market and the environment of economy is unstable and usually not predictable. Furthermore, engaging in stock trading requires time and effort to analyze, create strategies, and make decisions. It would be convenient and effective if an agent could assist or even do the task of analyzing and modeling the past data and then generate a strategy for autonomous trading. Recently, reinforcement learning has been shown to be robust in various tasks that involve achieving a goal with a decision making strategy based on time-series data. In this project, we have developed a pipeline that simulates the stock trading environment and have trained an agent to automate the stock trading process with deep reinforcement learning methods, including deep Q-learning, deep SARSA, and the policy gradient method. We evaluate our platform during relatively good (before 2021) and bad (2021 - 2022) situations. The stocks we've evaluated on including Google, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM. These stocks are among the popular ones, and the changes in trends are representative in terms of having good and bad situations. We showed that before 2021, the three reinforcement methods we have tried always provide promising profit returns with total annual rates around $70\%$ to $90\%$, while maintain a positive profit return after 2021 with total annual rates around 2% to 7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at ICLR 2023: AI for Agent Based Modeling</p></details> |

Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It is also found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue either enrich the connectivity data by incorporating social networks or external knowledge graphs, or fine-tune LLMs into interaction augmenters or next-item recommenders. However, these techniques tend to be resource demanding, requiring high computational power. They also have several limitations, including data availability, low quality, or synthetic noise issues. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR leverages latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Is Serendipity? An Interview Study to Conceptualize Experienced Serendipity in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15440v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serendipity has been associated with numerous benefits in the context of recommender systems, e.g., increased user satisfaction and consumption of long-tail items. Despite this, serendipity in the context of recommender systems has thus far remained conceptually ambiguous. This conceptual ambiguity has led to inconsistent operationalizations between studies, making it difficult to compare and synthesize findings. In this paper, we conceptualize the user's experience of serendipity. To this effect, we interviewed 17 participants and analyzed the data following the grounded theory paradigm. Based on these interviews, we conceptualize experienced serendipity as "a user experience in which a user unintentionally encounters content that feels fortuitous, refreshing, and enriching". We find that all three components -- fortuitous, refreshing and enriching -- are necessary and together are sufficient to classify a user's experience as serendipitous. However, these components can be satisfied through a variety of conditions. Our conceptualization unifies previous definitions of serendipity within a single framework, resolving inconsistencies by identifying distinct flavors of serendipity. It highlights underexposed flavors, offering new insights into how users experience serendipity in the context of recommender systems. By clarifying the components and conditions of experienced serendipity in recommender systems, this work can guide the design of recommender systems that stimulate experienced serendipity in their users, and lays the groundwork for developing a standardized operationalization of experienced serendipity in its many flavors, enabling more consistent and comparable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 tables, to be published in "Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization"</p></details> |

However, efficiently generating high-fidelity synthetic sparse data remains a significant challenge. We introduce Sparse Data Diffusion (SDD), a novel method for generating sparse data. SDD extends continuous state-space diffusion models with an explicit representation of exact zeros by modeling sparsity through the introduction of Sparsity Bits. Empirical validation in various domains, including two scientific applications in physics and biology, demonstrates that SDD achieves high fidelity in representing data sparsity while preserving the quality of the generated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15116v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[IntentRec: Predicting User Session Intent with Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05353v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have played a critical role in diverse digital services such as e-commerce, streaming media, social networks, etc. If we know what a user's intent is in a given session (e.g. do they want to watch short videos or a movie or play games; are they shopping for a camping trip), it becomes easier to provide high-quality recommendations. In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of IntentRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ BayLearn 2024</p></details> |

Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and benchmark datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/mohbattharani/KERL.</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2025 |
| **[The Limits of Graph Samplers for Training Inductive Recommender Systems: Extended results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14241v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive Recommender Systems are capable of recommending for new users and with new items thus avoiding the need to retrain after new data reaches the system. However, these methods are still trained on all the data available, requiring multiple days to train a single model, without counting hyperparameter tuning. In this work we focus on graph-based recommender systems, i.e., systems that model the data as a heterogeneous network. In other applications, graph sampling allows to study a subgraph and generalize the findings to the original graph. Thus, we investigate the applicability of sampling techniques for this task. We test on three real world datasets, with three state-of-the-art inductive methods, and using six different sampling methods. We find that its possible to maintain performance using only 50% of the training data with up to 86% percent decrease in training time; however, using less training data leads to far worse performance. Further, we find that when it comes to data for recommendations, graph sampling should also account for the temporal dimension. Therefore, we find that if higher data reduction is needed, new graph based sampling techniques should be studied and new inductive methods should be designed.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-dimensional Nonparametric Contextual Bandit Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14102v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret in terms of $\Delta$.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[Field Matters: A lightweight LLM-enhanced Method for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14057v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm. Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaCTR-EC46.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUSS: Multilevel Subset Selection for Relevance and Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11126v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of relevant and diverse subset selection has a wide range of applications, including recommender systems and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For example, in recommender systems, one is interested in selecting relevant items, while providing a diversified recommendation. Constrained subset selection problem is NP-hard, and popular approaches such as Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) are based on greedy selection. Many real-world applications involve large data, but the original MMR work did not consider distributed selection. This limitation was later addressed by a method called DGDS which allows for a distributed setting using random data partitioning. Here, we exploit structure in the data to further improve both scalability and performance on the target application. We propose MUSS, a novel method that uses a multilevel approach to relevant and diverse selection. In a recommender system application, our method can not only improve the performance up to $4$ percent points in precision, but is also $20$ to $80$ times faster. Our method is also capable of outperforming baselines on RAG-based question answering accuracy. We present a novel theoretical approach for analyzing this type of problems, and show that our method achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal objective. Moreover, our analysis also resulted in a $\times 2$ tighter bound for DGDS compared to previously known bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>model...</summary><p>model in production at Amazon</p></details> |
| **[Who You Are Matters: Bridging Topics and Social Roles via LLM-Enhanced Logical Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10940v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal) LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic tag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF presents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the extracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We conduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and public datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically show that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than the modeling of item topics. Additionally, we provide evidence that the extracted logic graphs are empirically a general and transferable knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Topology Bias Distort Message Passing? A Dirichlet Energy Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13892v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems have achieved remarkable effectiveness by modeling high-order interactions between users and items. However, such approaches are significantly undermined by popularity bias, which distorts the interaction graph's structure, referred to as topology bias. This leads to overrepresentation of popular items, thereby reinforcing biases and fairness issues through the user-system feedback loop. Despite attempts to study this effect, most prior work focuses on the embedding or gradient level bias, overlooking how topology bias fundamentally distorts the message passing process itself. We bridge this gap by providing an empirical and theoretical analysis from a Dirichlet energy perspective, revealing that graph message passing inherently amplifies topology bias and consistently benefits highly connected nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Test-time Simplicial Propagation (TSP), which extends message passing to higher-order simplicial complexes. By incorporating richer structures beyond pairwise connections, TSP mitigates harmful topology bias and substantially improves the representation and recommendation of long-tail items during inference. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in mitigating topology bias and enhancing recommendation quality.</p></details> |  |

As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL'25 Findings</p></details> |

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform), to serve the major online traffic. Codes will be released after this paper is published.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper, accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear. We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments; and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems.

We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as universal retrievers, capable of handling multiple objectives within a generative retrieval framework. To model complex user-item relationships within generative retrieval, we propose multi-query representation. To address the challenge of extremely large candidate sets in industrial recommender systems, we introduce matrix decomposition to boost model learnability, discriminability, and transferability, and we incorporate probabilistic sampling to reduce computation costs. Finally, our Universal Retrieval Model (URM) can adaptively generate a set from tens of millions of candidates based on arbitrary given objective while keeping the latency within tens of milliseconds. Applied to industrial-scale data, URM outperforms expert models elaborately designed for different retrieval objectives on offline experiments and significantly improves the core metric of online advertising platform by $3\%$.</p></details> |  |

As the demand for high-quality and large-scale data continues to rise, data copyright protection is attracting increasing attention. In this work, we explore the problem of data watermarking for sequential recommender systems, where a watermark is embedded into the target dataset and can be detected in models trained on that dataset. We focus on two settings: dataset watermarking, which protects the ownership of the entire dataset, and user watermarking, which safeguards the data of individual users. We present a method named Dataset Watermarking for Recommender Systems (DWRS) to address them. We define the watermark as a sequence of consecutive items inserted into normal users' interaction sequences. We define a Receptive Field (RF) to guide the inserting process to facilitate the memorization of the watermark. Extensive experiments on five representative sequential recommendation models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWRS in protecting data copyright while preserving model utility.</p></details> |  |

A typical FedRec involves transmitting the full model and entire weight updates between edge devices and the server, causing significant burdens to devices with limited bandwidth and computational power. While the sparsity of embedding updates provides opportunity for payload optimization, existing sparsity-aware federated protocols generally sacrifice privacy for efficiency. A key challenge in designing a secure sparsity-aware efficient protocol is to protect the rated item indices from the server. In this paper, we propose a lossless secure recommender systems on sparse embedding updates (SecEmb). SecEmb reduces user payload while ensuring that the server learns no information about both rated item indices and individual updates except the aggregated model. The protocol consists of two correlated modules: (1) a privacy-preserving embedding retrieval module that allows users to download relevant embeddings from the server, and (2) an update aggregation module that securely aggregates updates at the server. Empirical analysis demonstrates that SecEmb reduces both download and upload communication costs by up to 90x and decreases user-side computation time by up to 70x compared with secure FedRec protocols. Additionally, it offers non-negligible utility advantages compared with lossy message compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Fusion Strategies for Federated Multimodal Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08478v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delivering deeply personalized recommendations necessitates understanding user interactions with diverse multimedia features, but achieving this within the constraints of Federated Recommendation Systems (FedRec) is severely hampered by communication bottlenecks, user heterogeneity, and the complexity of privacy-preserving multimodal fusion. To this end, we propose FedMR, a novel multimodal FedRec framework centered around the Mixing Feature Fusion Module (MFFM). FedMR employs a two-stage process: (1) Server-side centralized multimedia content processing provides rich, shared item context using pre-trained models, mitigating limitations from client sparsity and resource constraints efficiently. (2) Client-Side Personalized Refinement, where the MFFM dynamically adapts these server-provided multimodal representations based on client-specific interaction patterns, effectively tailoring recommendations and resolving heterogeneity in user preferences towards different modalities. Extensive experiments validate that FedMR seamlessly enhances existing ID-based FedRecs, effectively transforming them into high-performing federated multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables, conference</p></details> |

Traditional attack strategies often rely on simplistic heuristics, require access to internal RS data, and overlook the manipulation potential of textual reviews. In this work, we introduce Agent4SR, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to perform low-knowledge, high-impact shilling attacks through both rating and review generation. Agent4SR simulates realistic user behavior by orchestrating adversarial interactions, selecting items, assigning ratings, and crafting reviews, while maintaining behavioral plausibility. Our design includes targeted profile construction, hybrid memory retrieval, and a review attack strategy that propagates target item features across unrelated reviews to amplify manipulation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and RS architectures demonstrate that Agent4SR outperforms existing low-knowledge baselines in both effectiveness and stealth. Our findings reveal a new class of emergent threats posed by LLM-driven agents, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced defenses in modern recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Quantile Estimation for Uncertain Watch Time in Short-Video Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12223v5)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting watch time is crucial for optimizing recommendations and user experience in short video platforms. However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch-time prediction and user engagement modeling.

| **[Conversational Recommendation System using NLP and Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11933v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's digitally-driven world, the demand for personalized and context-aware recommendations has never been greater. Traditional recommender systems have made significant strides in this direction, but they often lack the ability to tap into the richness of conversational data. This paper represents a novel approach to recommendation systems by integrating conversational insights into the recommendation process. The Conversational Recommender System integrates cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, leveraging machine learning algorithms like Apriori for Association Rule Mining, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Furthermore, sophisticated voice recognition technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, play a crucial role in accurate speech-to-text conversion, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The methodology incorporates a fusion of content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches, enhancing them with NLP techniques. This innovative integration ensures a more personalized and context-aware recommendation experience, particularly in marketing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in ISETE conference (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data Engineering 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381v5)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream policy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream allocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and user retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream allocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which restricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial recommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Visually-Aware Recommender Systems: An Adversarial Image Reconstruction and Detection Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07992v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rich visual data, such as images, becoming readily associated with items, visually-aware recommendation systems (VARS) have been widely used in different applications. Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To clarify what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves' are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases, and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring, policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns, and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated discrimination.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Future is Sparse: Embedding Compression for Scalable Retrieval in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11388v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry-scale recommender systems face a core challenge: representing entities with high cardinality, such as users or items, using dense embeddings that must be accessible during both training and inference. However, as embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale recommenders. We release our code at https://github.com/recombee/CompresSAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2025 and WWW2025@HCRS</p></details> |
| **[On the Role of Weight Decay in Collaborative Filtering: A Popularity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11318v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors. Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity. Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies. Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength, offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Intent Discovery to Recognition with Topic Modeling and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11176v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial, particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity. Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem, we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings. Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new customer intents in dynamic domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Generation of Preference Data for Recommendation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating a recommendation system in a controlled environment, to identify specific behaviors and user preferences, requires highly flexible synthetic data generation models capable of mimicking the patterns and trends of real datasets. In this context, we propose HYDRA, a novel preferences data generation model driven by three main factors: user-item interaction level, item popularity, and user engagement level. The key innovations of the proposed process include the ability to generate user communities characterized by similar item adoptions, reflecting real-world social influences and trends. Additionally, HYDRA considers item popularity and user engagement as mixtures of different probability distributions, allowing for a more realistic simulation of diverse scenarios. This approach enhances the model's capacity to simulate a wide range of real-world cases, capturing the complexity and variability found in actual user behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HYDRA through extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets. The results highlight its capability to replicate real-world data patterns, offering valuable insights for developing and testing recommendation systems in a controlled and realistic manner. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/SimoneMungari/HYDRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Item-Language Model for Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02844v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language Models (LLMs) have been extremely successful at tasks like complex dialogue understanding, reasoning and coding due to their emergent abilities. These emergent abilities have been extended with multi-modality to include image, audio, and video capabilities. Recommender systems, on the other hand, have been critical for information seeking and item discovery needs. Recently, there have been attempts to apply LLMs for recommendations. One difficulty of current attempts is that the underlying LLM is usually not trained on the recommender system data, which largely contains user interaction signals and is often not publicly available. Another difficulty is user interaction signals often have a different pattern from natural language text, and it is currently unclear if the LLM training setup can learn more non-trivial knowledge from interaction signals compared with traditional recommender system methods. Finally, it is difficult to train multiple LLMs for different use-cases, and to retain the original language and reasoning abilities when learning from recommender system data. To address these three limitations, we propose an Item-Language Model (ILM), which is composed of an item encoder to produce text-aligned item representations that encode user interaction signals, and a frozen LLM that can understand those item representations with preserved pretrained knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate both the importance of the language-alignment and of user interaction knowledge in the item encoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

By integrating Processing-In-Memory~(PIM) architectures, researchers can reduce data movement and enhance energy efficiency, paving the way for next-generation recommender models. Nevertheless, achieving performance and efficiency gains is challenging due to the complexity of the PIM design space and the intricate mapping of operators. In this paper, we demonstrate that automated PIM design is feasible even within the most demanding recommender model design space, spanning over $10^{54}$ possible architectures. We propose \methodname, which formulates the co-optimization of recommender models and PIM design as a combinatorial search over mixed-precision interaction operations, and parameterizes the search with a one-shot supernet encompassing all mixed-precision options. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on three Click-Through Rate benchmarks, showcasing the superiority of our automated design methodology over manual approaches. Our results indicate up to a 3.36$\times$ speedup, 1.68$\times$ area reduction, and 12.48$\times$ higher power efficiency compared to naively mapped searched designs and state-of-the-art handcrafted designs.</p></details> | GLSVLSI 2025 |

However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Approximate Biclique Counting over Large Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10471v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Memorize Recommendation Datasets? A Preliminary Study on MovieLens-1M](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have made all the code publicly available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/LLM-MemoryInspector</p></details> |  |

My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |

This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p < 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p < 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p < 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p < 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p < 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p < 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students.</p></details> |  |

Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method produces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold items while refining user representations in data-sparse environments. Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong baseline for future comparative studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing submission to CIKM 2025; 2 Figures; 4 Tables; 13 pages; Python code implementation example</p></details> |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify "high" achievable goals for inference. While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Adaptively-weighted Nearest Neighbors for Matrix Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09612v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical note, we introduce and analyze AWNN: an adaptively weighted nearest neighbor method for performing matrix completion. Nearest neighbor (NN) methods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines such as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in panel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very intuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees. However, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate choice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest neighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past two decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii and the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN addresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off inherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the theory via synthetic experiments.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing datasets predominantly focus on Western songs with mood terms derived from English, which may limit generalizability across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. To address this, we introduce `GlobalMood', a novel cross-cultural benchmark dataset comprising 1,180 songs sampled from 59 countries, with large-scale annotations collected from 2,519 individuals across five culturally and linguistically distinct locations: U.S., France, Mexico, S. Korea, and Egypt. Rather than imposing predefined mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related mood terms. We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors. Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain mood terms, despite being dictionary equivalents, are perceived cross-culturally. State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, as evidenced by improved alignment with human evaluations - particularly in non-English contexts. More broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMamba: Hyperbolic Mamba for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09205v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems have become a cornerstone of personalized services, adept at modeling the temporal evolution of user preferences by capturing dynamic interaction sequences. Existing approaches predominantly rely on traditional models, including RNNs and Transformers. Despite their success in local pattern recognition, Transformer-based methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity and a tendency toward superficial attention patterns, limiting their ability to infer enduring preference hierarchies in sequential recommendation data. Recent advances in Mamba-based sequential models introduce linear-time efficiency but remain constrained by Euclidean geometry, failing to leverage the intrinsic hyperbolic structure of recommendation data. To bridge this gap, we propose Hyperbolic Mamba, a novel architecture that unifies the efficiency of Mamba's selective state space mechanism with hyperbolic geometry's hierarchical representational power. Our framework introduces (1) a hyperbolic selective state space that maintains curvature-aware sequence modeling and (2) stabilized Riemannian operations to enable scalable training. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that Hyperbolic Mamba achieves 3-11% improvement while retaining Mamba's linear-time efficiency, enabling real-world deployment. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient, hierarchy-aware sequential modeling.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly focused on the algorithms, display, and evaluation methodologies of XRS. While current research and reviews primarily emphasize the algorithmic aspects, with fewer studies addressing the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) layer of XRS. Additionally, existing reviews lack a unified taxonomy for XRS and there is insufficient attention given to the emerging area of short video recommendations. In this study, we synthesize existing literature and surveys on XRS, presenting a unified framework for its research and development. The main contributions are as follows: 1) We adopt a lifecycle perspective to systematically summarize the technologies and methods used in XRS, addressing challenges posed by the diversity and complexity of algorithmic models and explanation techniques. 2) For the first time, we highlight the application of multimedia, particularly video-based explanations, along with its potential, technical pathways, and challenges in XRS. 3) We provide a structured overview of evaluation methods from both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. These findings provide valuable insights for the systematic design, progress, and testing of XRS.</p></details> | 2 Tables, 29 figures |

We propose an exploration system designed to efficiently allocate impressions to these fresh items. Our approach leverages a learned probabilistic model to predict an item's discoverability, which then informs a scalable and adaptive traffic allocation strategy. This system intelligently distributes exploration budgets, optimizing for the long-term benefit of the recommendation platform. The impact is a demonstrably more efficient cold-start process, leading to a significant increase in the discoverability of new content and ultimately enriching the item corpus available for exploitation, as evidenced by its successful deployment in a large-scale production environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 18th ACM Recsys Large Recsys Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Crossing Boundaries: Leveraging Semantic Divergences to Explore Cultural Novelty in Cooking Recipes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24027v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novelty modeling and detection is a core topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), central to numerous tasks such as recommender systems and automatic summarization. It involves identifying pieces of text that deviate in some way from previously known information. However, novelty is also a crucial determinant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience, as it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors, particularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty and innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and novelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural diversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI), the lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper understanding of these divergences. This gap limits quantifying and understanding cultural differences within computational frameworks. To address this, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that integrates knowledge from sociology and management. Central to our approach is GlobalFusion, a novel dataset comprising 500 dishes and approximately 100,000 cooking recipes capturing cultural adaptation from over 150 countries. By introducing a set of Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics for novelty, we leverage this dataset to analyze textual divergences when recipes from one community are modified by another with a different cultural background. The results reveal significant correlations between our cultural novelty metrics and established cultural measures based on linguistic, religious, and geographical distances. Our findings highlight the potential of our framework to advance the understanding and measurement of cultural diversity in AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to match the version accepted at ACM FAccT 2025.

We present TrialMatchAI, an AI-powered recommendation system that automates patient-to-trial matching by processing heterogeneous clinical data, including structured records and unstructured physician notes. Built on fine-tuned, open-source large language models (LLMs) within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, TrialMatchAI ensures transparency and reproducibility and maintains a lightweight deployment footprint suitable for clinical environments. The system normalizes biomedical entities, retrieves relevant trials using a hybrid search strategy combining lexical and semantic similarity, re-ranks results, and performs criterion-level eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This pipeline delivers explainable outputs with traceable decision rationales. In real-world validation, 92 percent of oncology patients had at least one relevant trial retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized data, enables secure local deployment, and allows seamless replacement of LLM components as more advanced models emerge. By enhancing efficiency and interpretability and offering lightweight, open-source deployment, TrialMatchAI provides a scalable solution for AI-driven clinical trial matching in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interest Changes: Considering User Interest Life Cycle in Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08471v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommendation systems, user interests are always in a state of constant flux. Typically, a user interest experiences a emergent phase, a stable phase, and a declining phase, which are referred to as the "user interest life-cycle". Recent papers on user interest modeling have primarily focused on how to compute the correlation between the target item and user's historical behaviors, without thoroughly considering the life-cycle features of user interest. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Deep Interest Life-cycle Network (DILN), which not only captures the interest life-cycle features efficiently, but can also be easily integrated to existing ranking models. DILN contains two key components: Interest Life-cycle Encoder Module constructs historical activity histograms of the user interest and then encodes them into dense representation. Interest Life-cycle Fusion Module injects the encoded dense representation into multiple expert networks, with the aim of enabling the specific phase of interest life-cycle to activate distinct experts. Online A/B testing reveals that DILN achieves significant improvements of +0.38% in CTR, +1.04% in CVR and +0.25% in duration per user, which demonstrates its effectiveness. In addition, DILN inherently increase the exposure of users' emergent and stable interests while decreasing the exposure of declining interests. DILN has been deployed on the Lofter App.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Popularity Bias Amplification in Recommender Systems Employed in the Entertainment Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04752v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have become an integral part of our daily online experience by analyzing past user behavior to suggest relevant content in entertainment domains such as music, movies, and books. Today, they are among the most widely used applications of AI and machine learning. Consequently, regulations and guidelines for trustworthy AI, such as the European AI Act, which addresses issues like bias and fairness, are highly relevant to the design, development, and evaluation of recommender systems. One particularly important type of bias in this context is popularity bias, which results in the unfair underrepresentation of less popular content in recommendation lists. This work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of popularity bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector. Analyzing datasets from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime, we demonstrate that an item's recommendation frequency is positively correlated with its popularity. As a result, user groups with little interest in popular content receive less accurate recommendations compared to those who prefer widely popular items. Furthermore, this work contributes to a better understanding of the connection between recommendation accuracy, calibration quality of algorithms, and popularity bias amplification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EWAF'25, summarizes fairness and popularity bias research presented in Dr. Kowald's habilitation: https://domkowald.github.io/documents/others/2024habilitation_recsys.pdf</p></details> |
| **[COMRECGC: Global Graph Counterfactual Explainer through Common Recourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07081v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an ''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an ''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238v6)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an innovative solution called User Interest Enhancement (UIE). UIE enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by leveraging the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors generated based on dynamic streaming clustering of similar users and items from multiple perspectives, which are stored and updated in memory networks. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance for users with sparse interest, but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end solution, UIE is easy to implement on top of existing ranking models. Furthermore, we extend our approach to long-tail items using similar methods, which also yields excellent improvements. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in an industrial RS. The results demonstrate that UIE substantially outperforms other existing approaches, especially for users with sparse interest. UIE has been deployed in several large-scale RSs at Tencent since 2022, which was made public on 21 May 2024. In addition, UIE-based methods have also been successfully applied in candidate generation, pre-ranking, and context-DNN stages. Multiple teams have developed solutions based on UIE, focusing on updating clustering algorithms and attention mechanisms. As far as we know, UIE has been applied in multiple RSs, advertising systems and search engines. The thoughts of UIE, dynamic streaming clustering and similarity enhancement, have inspired subsequent relevant works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences.

To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of accuracy, fairness, and diversity, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems.

| **[DARLR: Dual-Agent Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems with Dynamic Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07257v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for recommender systems, enabling effective policy learning by interacting with frozen world models. However, the reward functions in these world models, trained on sparse offline logs, often suffer from inaccuracies. Specifically, existing methods face two major limitations in addressing this challenge: (1) deterministic use of reward functions as static look-up tables, which propagates inaccuracies during policy learning, and (2) static uncertainty designs that fail to effectively capture decision risks and mitigate the impact of these inaccuracies. In this work, a dual-agent framework, DARLR, is proposed to dynamically update world models to enhance recommendation policies. To achieve this, a \textbf{\textit{selector}} is introduced to identify reference users by balancing similarity and diversity so that the \textbf{\textit{recommender}} can aggregate information from these users and iteratively refine reward estimations for dynamic reward shaping. Further, the statistical features of the selected users guide the dynamic adaptation of an uncertainty penalty to better align with evolving recommendation requirements. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DARLR, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/ArronDZhang/DARLR.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 |
| **[ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13163v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective tool for real-world recommender systems with its capacity to model the dynamic interest of users and its interactive nature. Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods. In this paper, a novel model-based Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, ROLeR, is proposed for reward and uncertainty estimation in recommendation systems. Specifically, a non-parametric reward shaping method is designed to refine the reward model. In addition, a flexible and more representative uncertainty penalty is designed to fit the needs of recommendation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase that ROLeR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

| **[A Generative Re-ranking Model for List-level Multi-objective Optimization at Taobao](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07197v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce recommendation systems aim to generate ordered lists of items for customers, optimizing multiple business objectives, such as clicks, conversions and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Traditional multi-objective optimization methods like formulas or Learning-to-rank (LTR) models take effect at item-level, neglecting dynamic user intent and contextual item interactions. List-level multi-objective optimization in the re-ranking stage can overcome this limitation, but most current re-ranking models focus more on accuracy improvement with context. In addition, re-ranking is faced with the challenges of time complexity and diversity. In light of this, we propose a novel end-to-end generative re-ranking model named Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer-Generator (SORT-Gen) for the less-studied list-level multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, SORT-Gen is divided into two parts: 1)Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer innovatively uses Transformer and ordered regression to accurately estimate multi-objective values for variable-length sub-lists. 2)Mask-Driven Fast Generation Algorithm combines multi-objective candidate queues, efficient item selection and diversity mechanism into model inference, providing a fast online list generation method. Comprehensive online experiments demonstrate that SORT-Gen brings +4.13% CLCK and +8.10% GMV for Baiyibutie, a notable Mini-app of Taobao. Currently, SORT-Gen has been successfully deployed in multiple scenarios of Taobao App, serving for a vast number of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Recommendations using Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06841v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations, delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of loyalty and survival.'' Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and recommendation systems in digital entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IEEE CAI 2025.

| **[RuleGenie: SIEM Detection Rule Set Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06701v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations. Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited, with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction, language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity, evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations' security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language), demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06612v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, due to the openness of recommender systems, they remain vulnerable to malicious attacks. Additionally, natural noise in training data and issues such as data sparsity can also degrade the performance of recommender systems. Therefore, enhancing the robustness of recommender systems has become an increasingly important research topic. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the robustness of recommender systems. Based on our investigation, we categorize the robustness of recommender systems into adversarial robustness and non-adversarial robustness. In the adversarial robustness, we introduce the fundamental principles and classical methods of recommender system adversarial attacks and defenses. In the non-adversarial robustness, we analyze non-adversarial robustness from the perspectives of data sparsity, natural noise, and data imbalance. Additionally, we summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics for evaluating the robustness of recommender systems. Finally, we also discuss the current challenges in the field of recommender system robustness and potential future research directions. Additionally, to facilitate fair and efficient evaluation of attack and defense methods in adversarial robustness, we propose an adversarial robustness evaluation library--ShillingREC, and we conduct evaluations of basic attack models and recommendation models.

| **[Negotiating the Shared Agency between Humans & AI in the Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15919v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart recommendation algorithms have revolutionized content delivery and improved efficiency across various domains. However, concerns about user agency arise from the algorithms' inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and one-way output (power asymmetry). This study introduces a dual-control mechanism aimed at enhancing user agency, empowering users to manage both data collection and, novelly, the degree of algorithmically tailored content they receive. In a between-subject experiment with 161 participants, we evaluated the impact of varying levels of transparency and control on user experience. Results show that transparency alone is insufficient to foster a sense of agency, and may even exacerbate disempowerment compared to displaying outcomes directly. Conversely, combining transparency with user controls-particularly those allowing direct influence on outcomes-significantly enhances user agency. This research provides a proof-of-concept for a novel approach and lays the groundwork for designing more user-centered recommender systems that emphasize user autonomy and fairness in AI-driven content delivery.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a gap between this method and the actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video recommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond merely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true interests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will leads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display advertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem from classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through user viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the study introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario than the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights on how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation and online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core business objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and, consequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison between the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted Logloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient solution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that focuses on a singular objective.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICMI ...</summary><p>ICMI 2025 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence April 05-06, 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-symbolic approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic learning offer a promising approach toward transparent and user-centric systems. In this work-in-progress, we investigate using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) as a neuro-symbolic approach for recommendations that learn logic-based rules over predefined, human-readable atoms. Each rule corresponds to a fuzzy logic expression, making the recommender's decision process inherently transparent. In contrast to black-box machine learning methods, our approach reveals the reasoning behind a recommendation while maintaining competitive performance. We evaluate our method on a synthetic and MovieLens 1M datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our results demonstrate that our approach accurately captures user behavior while providing a transparent decision-making process. Finally, the differentiable nature of this approach facilitates an integration with other neural models, enabling the development of hybrid, transparent recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the HyPer workshop, co-located with ACM UMAP 2025</p></details> |

The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods train Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent with greedy action selection or sampling strategy, and may suffer from suboptimal conversational planning. To address this, we present a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based CRS framework SAPIENT. SAPIENT consists of a conversational agent (S-agent) and a conversational planner (S-planner). S-planner builds a conversational search tree with MCTS based on the initial actions proposed by S-agent to find conversation plans. The best conversation plans from S-planner are used to guide the training of S-agent, creating a self-training loop where S-agent can iteratively improve its capability for conversational planning. Furthermore, we propose an efficient variant SAPIENT for trade-off between training efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that SAPIENT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and data are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/SAPIENT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |

These approaches typically fail to account for the cognitive processes that shape user preferences and decision-making. In this vision paper, we propose a hybrid user modeling framework based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R that integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of human memory. Our goal is to combine ACT-R's declarative memory, which is responsible for storing symbolic chunks along sub-symbolic activations, with its procedural memory, which contains symbolic production rules. This integration will help simulate how users retrieve past experiences and apply decision-making strategies. With this approach, we aim to provide more transparent recommendations, enable rule-based explanations, and facilitate the modeling of cognitive biases. We argue that our approach has the potential to inform the design of a new generation of human-centered, psychology-informed recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the HyPer workshop, co-located with ACM UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Large-scale Generative Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04180v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval. However, generative ranking systems are still understudied, particularly with respect to their effectiveness and feasibility in large-scale industrial settings. This paper investigates this topic at the ranking stage of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, a recommender system that serves hundreds of millions of users. Specifically, we first examine how generative ranking outperforms current industrial recommenders. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that the primary improvement in effectiveness stems from the generative architecture, rather than the training paradigm. To facilitate efficient deployment of generative ranking, we introduce GenRank, a novel generative architecture for ranking. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution through online A/B experiments. The results show that GenRank achieves significant improvements in user satisfaction with nearly equivalent computational resources compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |

Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Item Representations Directly from Multimodal Features for Effective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04960v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multimodal recommender systems predominantly leverage Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization to learn item representations by amalgamating item identity (ID) embeddings with multimodal features. Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/enoche/LIRDRec</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.</p></details> |  |

The transport network - responsible for interconnecting the radio access network and core networks - will increasingly face challenges in efficiently managing complex traffic patterns. The Network Digital Twin (NDT) concept emerges as a promising solution for testing configurations and algorithms in a virtual network before real-world deployment. In this context, this work designs an experimental platform with NDT in a transport network domain, synchronizing with the virtual counterpart and a recommendation system for what-if analysis, enabling intelligent decision-making for dynamic route optimization problems in 5G/B5G scenarios. Our NDT, composed of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), was evaluated across three different network topologies consisting of 8, 16, and 30 nodes. It achieved lower MAPE values for URLLC and eMBB slices, comparing latency predictions with actual latency after the solution implementation. These values indicate high accuracy, demonstrating the solution's effectiveness in generating precise insights into network performance if a particular solution were implemented.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Communications. \c{opyright}2025 IEEE.

However, the inherent exchange of information between agents and their interaction with external environments, such as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of sensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls, making it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper, we take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system development level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris enables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference monitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as an integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent development framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and performance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare, supply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result shows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and practicability for adoption.</p></details> |  |

While there has been significant work on improving and evaluating state-of-the-art models and measuring various properties of recommender system outputs, less attention has been given to the data itself, particularly how data has changed over time. Such documentation and analysis provide guidance and context for designing and evaluating recommender systems, particularly for evaluation designs making use of time (e.g., temporal splitting). In this paper, we present a temporal explanatory analysis of the UCSD Book Graph dataset scraped from Goodreads, a social reading and recommendation platform active since 2006. We measure the book interaction data using a set of activity, diversity, and fairness metrics; we then train a set of collaborative filtering algorithms on rolling training windows to observe how the same measures evolve over time in the recommendations. Additionally, we explore whether the introduction of algorithmic recommendations in 2011 was followed by observable changes in user or recommender system behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[M2Rec: Multi-scale Mamba for Efficient Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04445v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition. While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating User Understanding of Group Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04273v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Recommender Systems (GRS) employing social choice-based aggregation strategies have previously been explored in terms of perceived consensus, fairness, and satisfaction. At the same time, the impact of textual explanations has been examined, but the results suggest a low effectiveness of these explanations. However, user understanding remains fairly unexplored, even if it can contribute positively to transparent GRS. This is particularly interesting to study in more complex or potentially unfair scenarios when user preferences diverge, such as in a minority scenario (where group members have similar preferences, except for a single member in a minority position). In this paper, we analyzed the impact of different types of explanations on user understanding of group recommendations. We present a randomized controlled trial (n = 271) using two between-subject factors: (i) the aggregation strategy (additive, least misery, and approval voting), and (ii) the modality of explanation (no explanation, textual explanation, or multimodal explanation). We measured both subjective (self-perceived by the user) and objective understanding (performance on model simulation, counterfactuals and error detection). In line with recent findings on explanations for machine learning models, our results indicate that more detailed explanations, whether textual or multimodal, did not increase subjective or objective understanding. However, we did find a significant effect of aggregation strategies on both subjective and objective understanding. These results imply that when constructing GRS, practitioners need to consider that the choice of aggregation strategy can influence the understanding of users. Post-hoc analysis also suggests that there is value in analyzing performance on different tasks, rather than through a single aggregated metric of understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will be part of the UMAP 2025 conference.

| **[Modeling Domain and Feedback Transitions for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08209v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, many recommender systems encompass various domains to cater to users' diverse needs, leading to user behaviors transitioning across different domains. In fact, user behaviors across different domains reveal changes in preference toward recommended items. For instance, a shift from negative feedback to positive feedback indicates improved user satisfaction. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation methods typically model user interests by focusing solely on information about domain transitions, often overlooking the valuable insights provided by users' feedback transitions. In this paper, we propose $\text{Transition}^2$, a novel method to model transitions across both domains and types of user feedback. Specifically, $\text{Transition}^2$ introduces a transition-aware graph encoder based on user history, assigning different weights to edges according to the feedback type. This enables the graph encoder to extract historical embeddings that capture the transition information between different domains and feedback types. Subsequently, we encode the user history using a cross-transition multi-head self-attention, incorporating various masks to distinguish different types of transitions. To further enhance representation learning, we employ contrastive losses to align transitions across domains and feedback types. Finally, we integrate these modules to make predictions across different domains. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{Transition}^2$.</p></details> |  |

To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, we assess generated outputs through a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training)-based similarity, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), FID (Frechet Inception Distance), and retrieval-based measures, as well as qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate that structured metadata enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures. While not a traditional recommender system, our framework enables task-specific recommendations for model selection and prompt design based on evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03655v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Familiarizing with Music: Discovery Patterns for Different Music Discovery Needs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03568v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans have the tendency to discover and explore. This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs. Our findings open up possibilities to infer users' interest in unfamiliar music from streaming data as well as possibilities to develop recommender systems that guide users in exploring music in a more natural way.</p></details> |  |

This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings.

In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Adjun...</summary><p>Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization</p></details> |

Particular attention is drawn at the robustness, efficiency and scalability of these variable projection second-order algorithms such that they can be used also on larger datasets now commonly found in many practical problems for which only first-order algorithms based on sequential repetitions of local optimization (e.g., majorization, Expectation-Maximization or alternating least-squares methods) or variations of gradient descent (e.g., conjugate, proximal or stochastic gradient descent methods), or hybrid algorithms from these two classes of methods, were only feasible due to their lower cost and memory requirement per iteration. In parallel with this review of variable projection algorithms, we develop new formulae for the Jacobian and Hessian matrices involved in these variable projection methods and demonstrate their very specific properties such as the uniform rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix or the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix at the (local) minimizers of the cost function associated with the WLRA problem. These systematic deficiencies must be taken into account in any practical implementations of the algorithms. These different properties and the very particular geometry of the WLRA problem have not been well appreciated in the past and have been the main obstacles in the development of robust variable projection second-order algorithms for solving the WLRA problem. In addition, we demonstrate that the variable projection framework gives original insights on the solvability, the landscape and the non-smoothness of the WLRA problem. It also helps to describe the tight links between previously unrelated methods, which have been proposed to solve it. Specifically, we illustrate the closed links between the variable projection framework and Riemannian optimization on the Grassmann manifold for the WLRA problem. We expect that software's developers and practitioners in different fields such as computer vision, signal processing, recommender systems, machine learning, multivariate statistics and geophysical sciences will benefit from the results in this monograph in order to devise more robust and accurate algorithms to solve the WLRA problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Recommending Out-of-Domain Items: Constrained Generative Recommendation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03336v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption.

| **[LLM4Tag: Automatic Tagging System for Information Retrieval via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13481v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tagging systems play an essential role in various information retrieval applications such as search engines and recommender systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11225v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that can capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an increasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation systems, the cold-start problem caused by interaction sparsity has been impacting the effectiveness of recommendations for cold-start items. Many cold-start scheme based on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on offline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online recommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method, computational overhead and time constraints. Inspired by the above questions, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware Meta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming data settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks by predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and reweight behavior-related and content-related features in each task based on their different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to recommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly reduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods. Furthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional self-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging insights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing cold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, published in KDD '25</p></details> |
| **[Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03382v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization of Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00027v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become increasingly important with a wide range of applications. Despite the importance and recent progress, most existing works on personalized LLMs have focused either entirely on (a) personalized text generation or (b) leveraging LLMs for personalization-related downstream applications, such as recommendation systems. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two separate main directions for the first time by introducing a taxonomy for personalized LLM usage and summarizing the key differences and challenges. We provide a formalization of the foundations of personalized LLMs that consolidates and expands notions of personalization of LLMs, defining and discussing novel facets of personalization, usage, and desiderata of personalized LLMs. We then unify the literature across these diverse fields and usage scenarios by proposing systematic taxonomies for the granularity of personalization, personalization techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and applications of personalized LLMs. Finally, we highlight challenges and important open problems that remain to be addressed. By unifying and surveying recent research using the proposed taxonomies, we aim to provide a clear guide to the existing literature and different facets of personalization in LLMs, empowering both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms. We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source. The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty in Repeated Implicit Feedback as a Measure of Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02492v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems rely heavily on user feedback to learn effective user and item representations. Despite their widespread adoption, limited attention has been given to the uncertainty inherent in the feedback used to train these systems. Both implicit and explicit feedback are prone to noise due to the variability in human interactions, with implicit feedback being particularly challenging. In collaborative filtering, the reliability of interaction signals is critical, as these signals determine user and item similarities. Thus, deriving accurate confidence measures from implicit feedback is essential for ensuring the reliability of these signals. A common assumption in academia and industry is that repeated interactions indicate stronger user interest, increasing confidence in preference estimates. However, in domains such as music streaming, repeated consumption can shift user preferences over time due to factors like satiation and exposure. While literature on repeated consumption acknowledges these dynamics, they are often overlooked when deriving confidence scores for implicit feedback. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on music streaming, where repeated interactions are frequent and quantifiable. We analyze how repetition patterns intersect with key factors influencing user interest and develop methods to quantify the associated uncertainty. These uncertainty measures are then integrated as consistency metrics in a recommendation task. Our empirical results show that incorporating uncertainty into user preference models yields more accurate and relevant recommendations. Key contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty in repeated consumption patterns, the release of a novel dataset, and a Bayesian model for implicit listening feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Short Video Segment-level User Dynamic Interests Modeling in Personalized Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04237v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of short videos has necessitated effective recommender systems to match users with content tailored to their evolving preferences. Current video recommendation models primarily treat each video as a whole, overlooking the dynamic nature of user preferences with specific video segments. In contrast, our research focuses on segment-level user interest modeling, which is crucial for understanding how users' preferences evolve during video browsing. To capture users' dynamic segment interests, we propose an innovative model that integrates a hybrid representation module, a multi-modal user-video encoder, and a segment interest decoder. Our model addresses the challenges of capturing dynamic interest patterns, missing segment-level labels, and fusing different modalities, achieving precise segment-level interest prediction. We present two downstream tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our segment interest modeling approach: video-skip prediction and short video recommendation. Our experiments on real-world short video datasets with diverse modalities show promising results on both tasks. It demonstrates that segment-level interest modeling brings a deep understanding of user engagement and enhances video recommendations. We also release a unique dataset that includes segment-level video data and diverse user behaviors, enabling further research in segment-level interest modeling. This work pioneers a novel perspective on understanding user segment-level preference, offering the potential for more personalized and engaging short video experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods often lack a clear definition of similar users and face challenges when users with unique preferences lack appropriate neighbors. In such cases, relying on divergent preferences of misidentified neighbors can degrade recommendation quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive Collaborative Combinatorial Bandits algorithm (CoCoB). CoCoB employs an innovative two-sided bandit architecture, applying bandit principles to both the user and item sides. The user-bandit employs an enhanced Bayesian model to explore user similarity, identifying neighbors based on a similarity probability threshold. The item-bandit treats items as arms, generating diverse recommendations informed by the user-bandit's output. CoCoB dynamically adapts, leveraging neighbor preferences when available or focusing solely on the target user otherwise. Regret analysis under a linear contextual bandit setting and experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CoCoB's effectiveness, achieving an average 2.4% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by DASFAA 2025: The International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications.

| **[Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Stance Detection: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08464v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |

Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Misinformation Detection by Visiting Potential Commonsense Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21604v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Internet technology has led to an increased prevalence of misinformation, causing severe negative effects across diverse domains. To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

| **[A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Cognition and Emotion: Empathy-Driven Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17332v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation. Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim.

| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

| **[Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |

We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD) Journal.

We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines.

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much quicker than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation models need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalisation, an understudied problem in existing datasets. We identify 6 axes of generalisation-time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type-and design evaluation procedures for each. We also analyse some baseline models, highlighting how these fail important desiderata.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.

This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection.

A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |

Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion.

Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Examination on the Effectiveness of Divide-and-Conquer Prompting in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05359v6)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |

Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the highest increases of 20.69%, 23.94%, and 39.11% respectively. This work will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> |  |

Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |

Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Capabilities of LLMs across Scale and Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03146v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying misleading versus non-misleading news headlines. Utilizing a dataset of 60 articles, sourced from both reputable and questionable outlets across health, science & tech, and business domains, we employ three LLMs- ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini-for classification. Our analysis reveals significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human judgment. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI ethics, emphasizing the need for models that are not only technically advanced but also ethically aligned and sensitive to the subtleties of human interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 tables, 1st HEAL Workshop at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 12, Honolulu, HI, USA 2024</p></details> |

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective. Additionally, we provide a dataset on health misinformation, thoroughly annotated by experts utilizing our proposed scheme. Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-CoLING-2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</p></details> |  |

However, it is uncertain how the public may react to labels by automated fact-checkers. In this study, we investigate the use of automated warning labels derived from misinformation detection literature and investigate their effects on three forms of post engagement. Focusing on political posts, we also consider how partisanship affects engagement. In a two-phases within-subjects experiment with 200 participants, we found that the generic warnings suppressed intents to comment on and share posts, but not on the intent to like them. Furthermore, when different reasons for the labels were provided, their effects on post engagement were inconsistent, suggesting that the reasons could have undesirably motivated engagement instead. Partisanship effects were observed across the labels with higher engagement for politically congruent posts. We discuss the implications on the design and use of automated warning labels.</p></details> |  |

Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024</p></details> |

At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at K-CAP'23: The 12th Knowledge Capture Conference</p></details> |

Considerable efforts have focused on building misinformation detection models, still the perils of misinformation remain abound. Mitigating online misinformation and its ramifications requires a holistic approach that encompasses not only an understanding of its intricate landscape in relation to the complex issue and topic-rich information ecosystem online, but also the psychological drivers of individuals behind it. Adopting a time series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we conduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19 tweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the behavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19 and its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing misinformation on Non-COVID domains before the pandemic. Our analysis underscores the intricacies inherent to cross-domain misinformation, and highlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is positively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation sharing on emergent topics and beyond. This work may serve as a valuable foundation for designing user-centric inoculation strategies and ecologically-grounded agile interventions for effectively tackling online misinformation.</p></details> |  |

However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities, false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for the task of misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information. We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection in a South African Social Media Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04052v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments. Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence Research.

The expertly curated dataset includes annotations for 5,952 tweets, assessing their relevance to COVID-19 vaccines, presence of misinformation, and the themes of the misinformation. To address challenges posed by domain specificity, the low-resource setting, and data imbalance, we adopt two approaches for developing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation detection models: domain-specific pre-training and text augmentation using a large language model. Our best misinformation detection models demonstrate improvements ranging from 2.7 to 15.9 percentage points in macro F1-score compared to the baseline models. Additionally, we apply our misinformation detection models in a large-scale study of 19 million unlabeled tweets from the three countries between 2020 and 2022, showcasing the practical application of our dataset and models for detecting and analyzing vaccine misinformation in multiple countries and languages. Our analysis indicates that percentage changes in the number of new COVID-19 cases are positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rates in a staggered manner for Brazil and Indonesia, and there are significant positive associations between the misinformation rates across the three countries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Main conference), 9 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robust Domain Misinformation Detection via Multi-modal Feature Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14315v1)** | 2023-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher "credibility" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model. The formal implementation of this paper can be found in this link: https://github.com/less-and-less-bugs/RDCM</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TIFS 2023</p></details> |

However, the huge volumes of misinformation (e.g., fake news and rumors) that flood the internet can adversely affect people's lives, and have resulted in the emergence of rumor and fake news detection as a hot research topic. The emotions and sentiments of netizens, as expressed in social media posts and news, constitute important factors that can help to distinguish fake news from genuine news and to understand the spread of rumors. This article comprehensively reviews emotion-based methods for misinformation detection. We begin by explaining the strong links between emotions and misinformation. We subsequently provide a detailed analysis of a range of misinformation detection methods that employ a variety of emotion, sentiment and stance-based features, and describe their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss a number of ongoing challenges in emotion-based misinformation detection based on large language models and suggest future research directions, including data collection (multi-platform, multilingual), annotation, benchmark, multimodality, and interpretability.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Fake news has become increasingly common, especially in regional languages like Malayalam, due to the rapid publication and lack of editorial standards on some online sites. Fake news may have a terrible effect on society, causing people to make bad judgments, lose faith in authorities, and even engage in violent behavior. When we take into the context of India, there are many regional languages, and fake news is spreading in every language. Therefore, providing efficient techniques for identifying false information in regional tongues is crucial. Until now, little to no work has been done in Malayalam, extracting features from multiple modalities to classify fake news. Multimodal approaches are more accurate in detecting fake news, as features from multiple modalities are extracted to build the deep learning classification model. As far as we know, this is the first piece of work in Malayalam that uses multimodal deep learning to tackle false information. Models trained with more than one modality typically outperform models taught with only one modality. Our study in the Malayalam language utilizing multimodal deep learning is a significant step toward more effective misinformation detection and mitigation.</p></details> |  |

We establish a threat model and simulate potential misuse scenarios, both unintentional and intentional, to assess the extent to which LLMs can be utilized to produce misinformation. Our study reveals that LLMs can act as effective misinformation generators, leading to a significant degradation in the performance of ODQA systems. To mitigate the harm caused by LLM-generated misinformation, we explore three defense strategies: prompting, misinformation detection, and majority voting. While initial results show promising trends for these defensive strategies, much more work needs to be done to address the challenge of misinformation pollution. Our work highlights the need for further research and interdisciplinary collaboration to address LLM-generated misinformation and to promote responsible use of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023 (Findings; Long Paper)</p></details> |

Fake news, misinformation, and unverifiable facts on social media platforms propagate disharmony and affect society. In this paper, we consider the problem of online auditing of information flow/propagation with the goal of classifying news items as fake or genuine. Specifically, driven by experiential studies on real-world social media platforms, we propose a probabilistic Markovian information spread model over networks modeled by graphs. We then formulate our inference task as a certain sequential detection problem with the goal of minimizing the combination of the error probability and the time it takes to achieve correct decision. For this model, we find the optimal detection algorithm minimizing the aforementioned risk and prove several statistical guarantees. We then test our algorithm over real-world datasets. To that end, we first construct an offline algorithm for learning the probabilistic information spreading model, and then apply our optimal detection algorithm. Experimental study show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms in terms of accuracy and detection time.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[VERITE: A Robust Benchmark for Multimodal Misinformation Detection Accounting for Unimodal Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14133v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia content has become ubiquitous on social media platforms, leading to the rise of multimodal misinformation (MM) and the urgent need for effective strategies to detect and prevent its spread. In recent years, the challenge of multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) has garnered significant attention by researchers and has mainly involved the creation of annotated, weakly annotated, or synthetically generated training datasets, along with the development of various deep learning MMD models. However, the problem of unimodal bias has been overlooked, where specific patterns and biases in MMD benchmarks can result in biased or unimodal models outperforming their multimodal counterparts on an inherently multimodal task; making it difficult to assess progress. In this study, we systematically investigate and identify the presence of unimodal bias in widely-used MMD benchmarks, namely VMU-Twitter and COSMOS. To address this issue, we introduce the "VERification of Image-TExt pairs" (VERITE) benchmark for MMD which incorporates real-world data, excludes "asymmetric multimodal misinformation" and utilizes "modality balancing". We conduct an extensive comparative study with a Transformer-based architecture that shows the ability of VERITE to effectively address unimodal bias, rendering it a robust evaluation framework for MMD. Furthermore, we introduce a new method -- termed Crossmodal HArd Synthetic MisAlignment (CHASMA) -- for generating realistic synthetic training data that preserve crossmodal relations between legitimate images and false human-written captions. By leveraging CHASMA in the training process, we observe consistent and notable improvements in predictive performance on VERITE; with a 9.2% increase in accuracy.

This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the sensitivity of open-domain QA models to corpus pollution with misinformation documents. We curate both human-written and model-generated false documents that we inject into the evidence corpus of QA models and assess the impact on the performance of these systems. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable to even small amounts of evidence contamination brought by misinformation, with large absolute performance drops on all models. Misinformation attack brings more threat when fake documents are produced at scale by neural models or the attacker targets hacking specific questions of interest. To defend against such a threat, we discuss the necessity of building a misinformation-aware QA system that integrates question-answering and misinformation detection in a joint fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>AACL-...</summary><p>AACL-IJCNLP 2023 (main conference, long paper)</p></details> |

But many questions remain, including whether open-source models match closed ones, why these models excel or struggle with certain tasks, and what types of practical procedures can improve performance. We address these questions in the context of classification by evaluating three classes of models using eight datasets across three distinct tasks: named entity recognition, political party prediction, and misinformation detection. While larger LLMs often lead to improved performance, open-source models can rival their closed-source counterparts by fine-tuning. Moreover, supervised smaller models, like RoBERTa, can achieve similar or even greater performance in many datasets compared to generative LLMs. On the other hand, closed models maintain an advantage in hard tasks that demand the most generalizability. This study underscores the importance of model selection based on task requirements</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 Tables, 1 Figure</p></details> |

Given that LLM apps are developed by third parties and anecdotal evidence indicating inconsistent enforcement of policies by LLM platforms, sharing user data with these apps presents significant privacy risks. In this paper, we aim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM app ecosystems. We examine OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem as a case study. We propose an LLM-based framework to analyze the natural language specifications of GPT Actions (custom tools) and assess their data collection practices. Our analysis reveals that Actions collect excessive data across 24 categories and 145 data types, with third-party Actions collecting 6.03% more data on average. We find that several Actions violate OpenAI's policies by collecting sensitive information, such as passwords, which is explicitly prohibited by OpenAI. Lastly, we develop an LLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the consistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy policies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the collected data types are omitted, with only 5.8% of Actions clearly disclosing their data collection practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2025</p></details> |

Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HCRMP: A LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15793v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However, current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance. Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space. Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3% under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Telecommunications using Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24245v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs are still facing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like telecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to evolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines knowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to capture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols, standards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing their relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response generation. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing accuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex technical queries with precision. The proposed KG-RAG model attained an accuracy of 88% for question answering tasks on a frequently used telecom-specific dataset, compared to 82% for the RAG-only and 48% for the LLM-only approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to ICC 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications. copyright 2025 IEEE</p></details> |
| **[HybridProver: Augmenting Theorem Proving with LLM-Driven Proof Synthesis and Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15740v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal methods is pivotal for verifying the reliability of critical systems through rigorous mathematical proofs. However, its adoption is hindered by labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code, datasets, and LLMs are open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing LLM Safe Alignment with Safety Representation Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15710v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses, overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR), a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Federated Splitting Framework for LLMs: Security, Efficiency, and Adaptability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15683v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data, offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security, efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks, leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2. First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct results. Still, it remains unclear what the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning are. This paper shows that one important factor is the choice of the formal language. By comparing 4 formal languages on 3 datasets over 6 LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects both the syntactic and the semantic reasoning capability. Thereby, we introduce the intermediate language challenge, which is the challenge of picking a suitable formal language for neurosymbolic reasoning. Further, we compare the effects of using different in-context-learning examples in an ablation study. We conclude that on average, context-aware encodings help LLMs to reason, while there is no apparent effect of using comments or markdown syntax.</p></details> |  |

Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It is also found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue either enrich the connectivity data by incorporating social networks or external knowledge graphs, or fine-tune LLMs into interaction augmenters or next-item recommenders. However, these techniques tend to be resource demanding, requiring high computational power. They also have several limitations, including data availability, low quality, or synthetic noise issues. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR leverages latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our comprehensive experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings. We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code and data used in our experiments are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Backdoor-Data-Extraction.</p></details> | 19 pages |

We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives.

| **[SpecOffload: Unlocking Latent GPU Capacity for LLM Inference on Resource-Constrained Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10259v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at https://github.com/MobiSense/SpecOffload-public .</p></details> |  |

In particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions. The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in AIED'2025: In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education.

While recent advances integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors, Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR (Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise robustness.</p></details> | Interspeech 2025 |
| **[Benchmarking Post-Training Quantization in LLMs: Comprehensive Taxonomy, Unified Evaluation, and Comparative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13178v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training Quantization (PTQ) technique has been extensively adopted for large language models (LLMs) compression owing to its efficiency and low resource requirement. However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 fugures |

However, due to the lack of open-source LLM serving workloads, these systems are frequently evaluated under unrealistic workload assumptions. Consequently, performance may degrade when systems are deployed in real-world scenarios. This work presents BurstGPT, an LLM serving workload with 10.31 million traces from regional Azure OpenAI GPT services over 213 days. BurstGPT captures LLM serving characteristics from user, model and system perspectives: (1) User request concurrency: burstiness variations of requests in Azure OpenAI GPT services, revealing diversified concurrency patterns in different services and model types. (2) User conversation patterns: counts and intervals within conversations for service optimizations. (3) Model response lengths: auto-regressive serving processes of GPT models, showing statistical relations between requests and their responses. (4) System response failures: failures of conversation and API services, showing intensive resource needs and limited availability of LLM services in Azure. The details of the characteristics can serve multiple purposes in LLM serving optimizations, such as system evaluation and trace provisioning. In our demo evaluation with BurstGPT, frequent variations in BurstGPT reveal declines in efficiency, stability, or reliability in realistic LLM serving. We identify that the generalization of KV cache management, scheduling and disaggregation optimizations can be improved under realistic workload evaluations. BurstGPT is publicly available now at https://github.com/HPMLL/BurstGPT and is widely used to develop prototypes of LLM serving frameworks in the industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15524v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g., "positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r > 0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and transparency in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms, varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.</p></details> |  |

However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM, distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized. This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Set-LLM: A Permutation-Invariant LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15433v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches have relied mainly on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models, therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies. ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from educational interaction data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Latebreaking results track in AIED 2025(26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education JULY 22-26, 2025 PALERMO, ITALY)</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments. We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms, and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.</p></details> |  |

While refusal responses can be viewed as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals. We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do. This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.</p></details> |  |

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.</p></details> | 41 pages |

Although existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. We present a comprehensive benchmark KVFundaBench to systematically evaluate the effects of KV cache compression across diverse fundamental LLM capabilities, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals serval key findings: (1) \textit{Task-Dependent Degradation}; (2) \textit{Model-Type Robustness} (3) \textit{Prompt Length Vulnerability}; (4) \textit{Chunk-Level Superiority}; (5) \textit{Prompt-Gain Sensitivity}; (6) \textit{Long-Context Generation Sensitivity}. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\%$-$18\%$ performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowKV: Enhancing Multi-Turn Conversational Coherence in LLMs via Isolated Key-Value Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15347v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.</p></details> | 18 pages |

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., "*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the strategy in Chinese & US market regimes compared to established benchmarks. Our work extends LLMs capabilities to quantitative trading, providing a scalable architecture for financial signal extraction and portfolio construction.

| **[An Empirical Study of LLM Reasoning Ability Under Strict Output Length Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14350v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in test-time scaling. By making models think before answering, they are able to achieve much higher accuracy with extra inference computation. However, in many real-world scenarios, models are used under time constraints, where an answer should be given within a certain output length. It is unclear whether and how the reasoning ability of different LLMs remain effective under strict constraints. We take a first look at this problem by conducting an in-depth empirical study. Specifically, we test 30 LLMs on common reasoning datasets under a wide range of output length budgets, and we analyze the correlation between the inference accuracy and various properties including model type, model size, prompt style, etc. We also consider the mappings between token budgets and actual on-device latency budgets. The results have demonstrated several interesting findings regarding the budget-aware LLM reasoning ability that differ from the unconstrained situation, e.g. the optimal choices of either model size or prompt style change under different budgets. These findings offer timely evaluation to this area and practical guidance for users to deploy LLMs under real-world latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Less Language is More: Language-Reasoning Disentanglement Makes LLMs Better Multilingual Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15257v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning 11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for improving cross-lingual generalization.</p></details> | 26 pages, 13 figures |

We show that existing Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering, significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in UAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multilingual Prompting for Improving LLM Generation Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15229v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting: a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses, and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.</p></details> |  |

We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 15 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 78% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.</p></details> |  |

So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version of the paper</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation, we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive, multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited to complex, interactive environments.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, existing intent clustering methods often fail to align with human perceptions due to a heavy reliance on embedding distance metrics and a tendency to overlook underlying semantic structures. This paper proposes an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) proposes context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. As existing English benchmarks offer limited semantic diversity and intent groups, we introduce a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset, comprising over 100k real customer service calls and 1,507 human-annotated intent clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable enhancements in clustering quality and lower computational cost. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the potential of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable and human-aligned intent clustering.</p></details> |  |

However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.</p></details> |  |

While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Prolonged Reasoning Is Not All You Need: Certainty-Based Adaptive Routing for Efficient LLM/MLLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15154v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks. To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multilingual, Culture-First Approach to Addressing Misgendering in LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20302v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misgendering is the act of referring to someone by a gender that does not match their chosen identity. It marginalizes and undermines a person's sense of self, causing significant harm. English-based approaches have clear-cut approaches to avoiding misgendering, such as the use of the pronoun ``they''. However, other languages pose unique challenges due to both grammatical and cultural constructs. In this work we develop methodologies to assess and mitigate misgendering across 42 languages and dialects using a participatory-design approach to design effective and appropriate guardrails across all languages. We test these guardrails in a standard LLM-based application (meeting transcript summarization), where both the data generation and the annotation steps followed a human-in-the-loop approach. We find that the proposed guardrails are very effective in reducing misgendering rates across all languages in the summaries generated, and without incurring loss of quality. Our human-in-the-loop approach demonstrates a method to feasibly scale inclusive and responsible AI-based solutions across multiple languages and cultures. We release the guardrails and synthetic dataset encompassing 42 languages, along with human and LLM-judge evaluations, to encourage further research on this subject.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Entropy Minimization in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15134v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any labeled data or even any parameter updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |

Decentralized training has emerged as a promising paradigm to leverage dispersed resources across clusters, datacenters and regions, offering the potential to democratize LLM development for broader communities. As the first comprehensive exploration of this emerging field, we present decentralized LLM training as a resource-driven paradigm and categorize existing efforts into community-driven and organizational approaches. We further clarify this through: (1) a comparison with related paradigms, (2) a characterization of decentralized resources, and (3) a taxonomy of recent advancements. We also provide up-to-date case studies and outline future directions to advance research in decentralized LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110v7)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning-Search Interleaved LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15117v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use. While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized) significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications.

Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zxh20001117/StepSearch.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

A Case Study on Entity Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11441v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.</p></details> |  |

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on a variety of models show that the best-performing model (GPT-4o) achieves a full sequence match accuracy of 28% and a win-rate of 60%, necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress. We have released the NESTFUL dataset under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/IBM/NESTFUL.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available in anonymous Github: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ThinkRec_LLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods inadequately handle data uncertainty in open-world scenarios, especially concerning limited labeling and unknown-class nodes. Prior solutions typically rely on isolated semantic or structural approaches for unknown-class rejection, lacking effective annotation pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose Open-world Graph Assistant (OGA), an LLM-based framework that combines adaptive label traceability, which integrates semantics and topology for unknown-class rejection, and a graph label annotator to enable model updates using newly annotated nodes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate OGA's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |

LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 Pa...</summary><p>36 Pages, 26 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to 3.8% on LongVideoBench, 4.1% on VideoMME, and 4.0% on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.</p></details> |  |

For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.</p></details> |  |

Adapting psychometric principles, we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses, and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on 90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels, models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning, and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for classification tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.</p></details> |  |

Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these biases, but most work studies biases in LLMs as a black-box problem without considering how concepts are represented within the model. We adapt techniques from representation engineering to study how the concept of "gender" is represented within LLMs. We introduce a new method that extracts concept representations via probability weighting without labeled data and efficiently selects a steering vector for measuring and manipulating the model's representation. We also present a projection-based method that enables precise steering of model predictions and demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating gender bias in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hannahxchen/gender-bias-steering</p></details> |  |

Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.</p></details> |  |

We analyze three common multiple-choice datasets using low-rank adaptation ensembles based on Mistral-7b, and draw quantitative and qualitative conclusions on their perceived complexity and balance between retained prior knowledge and domain specific adaptation during and after fine-tuning. We identify unexpected retention of acquired knowledge during fine-tuning in the overfitting regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICLR2025 Workshop "Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models: The Next Frontier in Reliable AI"</p></details> |

However, these methods introduce severe workload imbalances, limiting their practicality for large-scale distributed training. We propose DynMo, an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution that ensures optimal compute distribution when using pipeline parallelism in training dynamic models. DynMo adaptively balances workloads, dynamically packs tasks into fewer workers to free idle resources, and supports both multi-GPU single-node and multi-node systems. Compared to static training methods (Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed), DynMo accelerates training by up to 1.23x (MoEs), 3.18x (pruning), 2.23x (layer freezing), 4.02x (sparse attention), 4.52x (early exit), and 1.17x (MoDs).

Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation. In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making mixed-query evaluation crucial. We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios, leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective. Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain queries in a single prompt.</p></details> | 32 pages |

To address this, we introduce WebNovelBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-form novel generation. WebNovelBench leverages a large-scale dataset of over 4,000 Chinese web novels, framing evaluation as a synopsis-to-story generation task. We propose a multi-faceted framework encompassing eight narrative quality dimensions, assessed automatically via an LLM-as-Judge approach. Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling abilities and offering insights for future development. This benchmark provides a scalable, replicable, and data-driven methodology for assessing and advancing LLM-driven narrative generation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

Based on the phenomenon we propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based solely on key similarity. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We provide a theoretical basis for KeyDiff by relating key diversity with attention scores. These results imply KeyDiff can efficiently identify the most important tokens to retain. Notably KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. Under a strict memory allowance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff for the Llama and Qwen model families by observing a performance gap of less than 0.04% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$23% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on LongBench for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B. We also observe near baseline performance for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on the Math500 reasoning benchmark and decrease end-to-end inference latency by up to 30% compared to the other token-eviction methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings explicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push the planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints encourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their performance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs such as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently delivers strong performance, achieving higher task success rates and better cost efficiency. CATS provides an effective solution for budget-aware decision-making by combining the reasoning power of LLMs with structured search.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams. This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely, natural, and engaging conversational AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/lzk901372/MM-When2Speak</p></details> |

While LLMs excel at reasoning and generalization, they struggle with time-series inputs due to limited semantic context, numerical complexity, and sequence variability. To address these challenges, we construct SensorQA, a question-answering dataset of human-intuitive sensor-text pairs spanning diverse HAR scenarios. It supervises the Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where the model aligns sensor inputs with trend descriptions. Special tokens are introduced to mark channel boundaries. This alignment enables LLMs to interpret numerical patterns, channel-specific signals, and variable-length inputs--without requiring human annotation. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we adapt the model for multivariate HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that, guided by human-intuitive alignment, SensorLLM becomes an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier--generalizing across varied HAR settings and paving the way for foundation model research in time-series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.</p></details> |  |

Authentic character knowledge is crucial for constructing realistic LLM role-playing agents. However, existing works usually overlook the exploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE) and unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to low-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this paper, we propose RoleKE-Bench to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors in KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to detect these two types of errors effectively, especially when it comes to familiar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and propose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt (S$^2$RD), to explore further the potential for improving error detection capabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs' ability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that requires ongoing attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior work that focuses on inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini, achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for future research in logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.</p></details> | Preprint |

While current code benchmarks and instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked. We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code & Model is https://github.com/Luowaterbi/CTF-Instruct</p></details> |
| **[Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07115v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm that minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory. More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate the performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we introduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that computes the minimum total inference latency under full future information. Second, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by the computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we propose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under certain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also demonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the hindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical evaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the Llama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, we empirically observe that the activations of pre-trained LLMs exhibit low-rank property. Motivated by such observations, we propose CoLA and its memory-efficient implementation, CoLA-M, to replace these full-size layers with compute-efficient auto-encoders that naturally enforce low-rank activations throughout training. This fundamental architectural change eliminates the activation redundancy and significantly boosts model capacity and training efficiency. Experiments on LLaMA models with 60 million to 7 billion parameters show that CoLA reduces the computing cost by $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ and improves training throughput by $\bf 1.86\pmb{\times}$ while maintaining full-rank level performance. CoLA-M further squeezes memory cost without sacrificing throughput, offering a pre-training approach with collectively superior parameter, computing, and memory efficiency. The LLMs produced are also $\bf 2\pmb{\times}$ smaller, enabling faster inference with lower memory cost on resource-constrained platforms.</p></details> | v2 |
| **[Can LLMs be Good Graph Judge for Knowledge Graph Construction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17388v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, most of the data obtained from the information retrieval (IR) system is unstructured. Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods: (1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract inaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination phenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an entity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents. And we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of generated KGs. Experiments conducted on two general and one domain-specific text-graph pair datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against various baseline methods with strong generalization abilities. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudge}{https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudge}.</p></details> |  |
| **[KunServe: Efficient Parameter-centric Memory Management for LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18169v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued. This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: 19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Internal Chain-of-Thought: Empirical Evidence for Layer-wise Subtask Scheduling in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14530v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method, confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation steering.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Evaluating the Correctness of Inference Patterns Used by LLMs for Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09083v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a method to analyze the inference patterns used by Large Language Models (LLMs) for judgment in a case study on legal LLMs, so as to identify potential incorrect representations of the LLM, according to human domain knowledge. Unlike traditional evaluations on language generation results, we propose to evaluate the correctness of the detailed inference patterns of an LLM behind its seemingly correct outputs. To this end, we quantify the interactions between input phrases used by the LLM as primitive inference patterns, because recent theoretical achievements have proven several mathematical guarantees of the faithfulness of the interaction-based explanation. We design a set of metrics to evaluate the detailed inference patterns of LLMs. Experiments show that even when the language generation results appear correct, a significant portion of the inference patterns used by the LLM for the legal judgment may represent misleading or irrelevant logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis by LLM-Generated Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14499v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities. However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However, some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.</p></details> |  |

We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |

However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs. We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, our comprehensive analysis with more than 8,500 LLMs reveals a novel model-level scaling up phenomenon in Routing LLMs, i.e., a capable router can significantly enhance the performance of this paradigm as the number of candidates increases. This improvement can even surpass the performance of the best single model in the pool and many existing strong LLMs, confirming it a highly promising paradigm. However, the lack of comprehensive and open-source benchmarks for Routing LLMs has hindered the development of routers. In this paper, we introduce RouterEval, a benchmark tailored for router research, which includes over 200,000,000 performance records for 12 popular LLM evaluations across various areas such as commonsense reasoning, semantic understanding, etc., based on over 8,500 various LLMs. Using RouterEval, extensive evaluations of existing Routing LLM methods reveal that most still have significant room for improvement.

However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While existing approaches predict future motion states with the extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight architecture.</p></details> | In submission |

With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

While mixed-dataset training is widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy.

QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, quantum architecture search, unsupervised representation learning</p></details> |

These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/vivekmyers/contrastive_planning</p></details> |

Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a) adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in various settings. \footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}{github.com/sowonjeong/lobstur-graph-bootstrap}.}</p></details> |  |

Contrastive training has gained prominence for multimodal alignment, utilizing large-scale unlabeled data to learn shared representations. Existing deep learning approach for trimodal alignment involves two-stages, that separately align visual-text and audio-text modalities. This approach suffers from mismatched data distributions, resulting in suboptimal alignment. Leveraging the AVCaps dataset, which provides audio, visual and audio-visual captions for video clips, our method jointly optimizes the representation of all the modalities using contrastive training. Our results demonstrate that the single-stage approach outperforms the two-stage method, achieving a two-fold improvement in audio based visual retrieval, highlighting the advantages of unified multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025)</p></details> |

While Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models, commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared, transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our $7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module, which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable representation learning in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the current multi-view clustering methods are limited to specific domains or rely on a suboptimal and computationally intensive two-stage process of representation learning and clustering. We propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework for general data types (such as images and tables). Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Cluster assignments are learned by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound on the error caused by incorrect pseudo-labels in the unsupervised representations compared to LDA. Extensive experiments on ten multi-view clustering benchmark datasets provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/weihaox/RETRO</p></details> |

However, existing studies predominantly focus on small-scale, simplified two-dimensional scenarios, often overlooking realistic environmental perturbations, motion dynamics, and inherent heterogeneity--factors that pose substantial challenges to real-world applicability. To bridge this gap, we investigate large-scale heterogeneous perimeter-defense game in a three-dimensional setting, incorporating realistic elements such as motion dynamics and wind fields. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategies for both attackers and defenders, characterize the victory regions, and validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulations. To tackle large-scale heterogeneous control challenges in defense strategies, we propose an Embedded Mean-Field Actor-Critic (EMFAC) framework. EMFAC leverages representation learning to enable high-level action aggregation in a mean-field manner, supporting scalable coordination among defenders. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight agent-level attention mechanism based on reward representation, which selectively filters observations and mean-field information to enhance decision-making efficiency and accelerate convergence in large-scale tasks. Extensive simulations across varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of EMFAC, which outperforms established baselines in both convergence speed and overall performance. To further validate practicality, we test EMFAC in small-scale real-world experiments and conduct detailed analyses, offering deeper insights into the framework's effectiveness in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks, without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that "beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the label information is not always effectively utilized in the traditional GCN framework. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which enables the message passing can effectively utilize label information. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: (i) privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and (ii) residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations.

Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> |

However, existing models face significant challenges in scaling to large circuits due to limitations like over-squashing in graph neural networks and the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models. To address these issues, we introduce DeepGate4, a scalable and efficient graph transformer specifically designed for large-scale circuits. DeepGate4 incorporates several key innovations: (1) an update strategy tailored for circuit graphs, which reduce memory complexity to sub-linear and is adaptable to any graph transformer; (2) a GAT-based sparse transformer with global and local structural encodings for AIGs; and (3) an inference acceleration CUDA kernel that fully exploit the unique sparsity patterns of AIGs. Our extensive experiments on the ITC99 and EPFL benchmarks show that DeepGate4 significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15.5% and 31.1% performance improvements over the next-best models. Furthermore, the Fused-DeepGate4 variant reduces runtime by 35.1% and memory usage by 46.8%, making it highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of DeepGate4 to handle complex EDA tasks while offering superior scalability and efficiency.

In this work, we propose a novel self-disentangled MAE for learning expressive, discriminative, and transferable 4D representations. To overcome the first limitation, we learn motion by aligning high-level semantics in the latent space \textit{without any explicit knowledge}. To tackle the second, we introduce a \textit{self-disentangled learning} strategy that incorporates the latent token with the geometry token within a shared decoder, effectively disentangling low-level geometry and high-level semantics. In addition to the reconstruction objective, we employ three alignment objectives to enhance temporal understanding, including frame-level motion and video-level global information. We show that our pre-trained encoder surprisingly discriminates spatio-temporal representation without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on MSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both coarse-grained and fine-grained 4D downstream tasks. Notably, Uni4D improves action segmentation accuracy on HOI4D by $+3.8\%$.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we take an alternative approach to enhance the robustness of MLLMs under distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of three MLLMs on open-ended and closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45 datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a minimal sufficient representation.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown promising results in handling OOD data through generalization techniques, they often require specialized hardware that may not be accessible to all users. We present TCL, a lightweight yet effective solution that operates efficiently on standard CPU hardware. Our approach adapts contrastive learning principles specifically for tabular data structures, incorporating full matrix augmentation and simplified loss calculation. Through comprehensive experiments across 10 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that TCL outperforms existing models, including FT-Transformer and ResNet, particularly in classification tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in regression problems. TCL achieves these results with significantly reduced computational requirements, making it accessible to users with limited hardware capabilities. This study also provides practical guidance for detecting and evaluating OOD data through straightforward experiments and visualizations. Our findings show that TCL offers a promising balance between performance and efficiency in handling OOD prediction tasks, which is particularly beneficial for general machine learning practitioners working with computational constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on IEEE IAICT 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards the Causal Complete Cause of Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14058v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause $C^3$. We begin by defining $C^3$, which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of $C^3$ and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying $C^3$ with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing $C^3$ risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$. We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Driven Local-Whole Elastic Deformation Modeling for Point Cloud Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13812v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing point cloud representation learning tend to learning the geometric distribution of objects through data-driven approaches, emphasizing structural features while overlooking the relationship between the local information and the whole structure. Local features reflect the fine-grained variations of an object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape. In real-world, objects undergo elastic deformation under external forces, and this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric properties. Inspired by this, we propose a physics-driven self-supervised learning method for point cloud representation, which captures the relationship between parts and the whole by constructing a local-whole force propagation mechanism. Specifically, we employ a dual-task encoder-decoder framework, integrating the geometric modeling capability of implicit fields with physics-driven elastic deformation. The encoder extracts features from the point cloud and its tetrahedral mesh representation, capturing both geometric and physical properties. These features are then fed into two decoders: one learns the whole geometric shape of the point cloud through an implicit field, while the other predicts local deformations using two specifically designed physics information loss functions, modeling the deformation relationship between local and whole shapes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in object classification, few-shot learning, and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive acoustic experiences.

Recent advances in surgical phase recognition technology have focused primarily on Transform-based methods, although methods that extract spatial features from individual frames using a CNN and video features from the resulting time series of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance. However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs employed for feature extraction or representation learning in surgical phase recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in surgical workflow analysis using a vision-language model (ReSW-VL). Our proposed method involves fine-tuning the image encoder of a CLIP (Convolutional Language Image Model) vision-language model using prompt learning for surgical phase recognition. The experimental results on three surgical phase recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to conventional methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose FORMED, a novel framework for repurposing a backbone foundation model, pre-trained on generic time series, to enable highly generalizable MedTS classification on unseen datasets. FORMED combines the backbone with a novel classifier comprising two components: (1) task-specific channel embeddings and label queries, dynamically sized to match any number of channels and target classes, and (2) a shared decoding attention layer, jointly trained across datasets to capture medical domain knowledge through task-agnostic feature-query interactions. After repurposing, FORMED achieves seamless adaptation to unseen MedTS datasets through lightweight label query training (0.1% of parameters), eliminating the need for full fine-tuning or architectural redesign. We evaluate FORMED on 5 diverse MedTS datasets, benchmarking against 11 Task-Specific Models (TSM) and 4 Task-Specific Adaptation (TSA) methods. Our results demonstrate FORMED's dominant performance, achieving up to 35% absolute improvement in F1-score (on ADFTD dataset) over specialized baselines. Further analysis reveals consistent generalization across varying channel configurations, time series lengths, and clinical tasks, which are key challenges in real-world deployment. By decoupling domain-invariant representation learning from task-specific adaptation, FORMED establishes a scalable and resource-efficient paradigm for foundation model repurposing in healthcare. This approach prioritizes clinical adaptability over rigid task-centric design, offering a practical pathway for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores. Our experiments on COCO demonstrate notable improvements over ViTs in learned representation quality across text-to-image (+47%) and image-to-text retrieval (+44%) tasks. Furthermore, we showcase the advantages on compositionality benchmarks such as ARO (+18%) and Winoground (+10%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR Workshops 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies analyze sentiment based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features, enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Low-Latency Event Stream-based Visual Object Tracking: A Slow-Fast Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12903v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years, offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework first performs graph-based representation learning from high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones, yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world scenarios. The source code has been released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SlowFast_Event_Track.</p></details> |  |

The prediction model aims to minimize the worst-case risk among a class of distributions, a.k.a., an uncertainty set. Causality provides a modeling framework with a rigorous robustness guarantee in the above sense, where the uncertainty set is data-driven rather than pre-specified as in traditional distributional robustness optimization. However, current causality-inspired robustness methods possess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where the causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear. In this work, we propose a nonlinear method under a causal framework by incorporating recent developments in identifiable representation learning and establish a distributional robustness guarantee. To our best knowledge, this is the first causality-inspired robustness method with such a finite-radius robustness guarantee in nonlinear settings. Empirical validation of the theoretical findings is conducted on both synthetic data and real-world single-cell data, also illustrating that finite-radius robustness is crucial.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Enhanced Representation Learning for Single-Cell Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09427v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity. Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Mechanisms of Adversarial Data Augmentation for Robust and Adaptive Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12681v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training, improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home -- demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for cross-domain transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forest Autoencoders for Guided Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13257v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research has produced robust methods for unsupervised data visualization. Yet supervised visualization$\unicode{x2013}$where expert labels guide representations$\unicode{x2013}$remains underexplored, as most supervised approaches prioritize classification over visualization. Recently, RF-PHATE, a diffusion-based manifold learning method leveraging random forests and information geometry, marked significant progress in supervised visualization. However, its lack of an explicit mapping function limits scalability and its application to unseen data, posing challenges for large datasets and label-scarce scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Random Forest Autoencoders (RF-AE), a neural network-based framework for out-of-sample kernel extension that combines the flexibility of autoencoders with the supervised learning strengths of random forests and the geometry captured by RF-PHATE. RF-AE enables efficient out-of-sample supervised visualization and outperforms existing methods, including RF-PHATE's standard kernel extension, in both accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, RF-AE is robust to the choice of hyperparameters and generalizes to any kernel-based dimensionality reduction method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Invariant Risk Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12506v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments. In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel ``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and generalizing across environments without access to labels.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the learned representations from multi-modal contrastive learning beyond linear representations and specific data distributions. Our analysis reveals that, enabled by temperature optimization, multi-modal contrastive learning not only maximizes mutual information between modalities but also adapts to intrinsic dimensions of data, which can be much lower than user-specified dimensions for representation vectors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of contrastive learning to learn low-dimensional and informative representations, bridging theoretical insights and practical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Residual Quantization: Discrete Representations for Data with Latent Hierarchies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12404v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching, necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture latent hierarchies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p></details> | preprint |

Many recent approaches enhance retinal image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs, associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data, indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal disease analysis.

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

| **[Structured Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12143v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.</p></details> |  |

While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated figure layout, added project page link</p></details> |

Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first reveal that the information conflicts in current visual MBRL algorithms stem from visual representation learning and latent dynamics modeling with an information-theoretic perspective. Based on this finding, we present a new algorithm to resolve information conflicts for visual MBRL, named MInCo, which mitigates information conflicts by leveraging negative-free contrastive learning, aiding in learning invariant representation and robust policies despite noisy observations. To prevent the dominance of visual representation learning, we introduce time-varying reweighting to bias the learning towards dynamics modeling as training proceeds. We evaluate our method on several robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions. Our experiments demonstrate that MInCo learns invariant representations against background noise and consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art visual MBRL methods.

However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an external and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtains representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer with higher noise to that in the later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that are heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Self-...</summary><p>Self-Representation Alignment for Diffusion Transformers.

This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit cross-modal misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize cross-modal misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: Selection bias, where some semantic variables are absent in the text, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are altered -- both leading to misalignment in data pairs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings via extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of cross-modal misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |

The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact. Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since, until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks (predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design choices.</p></details> |  |

However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Residual Feature Integration is Sufficient to Prevent Negative Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11771v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning toolbox.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn to Think: Bootstrapping LLM Reasoning Capability Through Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06321v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

| **[Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11719v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

| **[Invariant Representations via Wasserstein Correlation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11702v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the use of Wasserstein correlation -- a normalized measure of statistical dependence based on the Wasserstein distance between a joint distribution and the product of its marginals -- for unsupervised representation learning. Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which naturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded distributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while approximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input distribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation maximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from scratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is approximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of augmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties of the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion of an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When the maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed to the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the desired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which show that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or can, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under this training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results for optimal transport-based dependence measures.

| **[Urban Representation Learning for Fine-grained Economic Mapping: A Semi-supervised Graph-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11645v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities, seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model. Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise economic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Society Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). 70 pages, 10 Figures, 15 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Nerve Fiber Distribution Patterns in 3D-PLI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17207v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A comprehensive understanding of the organizational principles in the human brain requires, among other factors, well-quantifiable descriptors of nerve fiber architecture. Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is a microscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grained organization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptors characterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enable downstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering, and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterization of fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we propose the application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiber architecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. We introduce a 3D-Context Contrastive Learning (CL-3D) objective that utilizes the spatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections of a 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. We combine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentations to gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approach is demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkey brain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to different configurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutive brain sections arising from histological processing. We demonstrate their practical applicability for retrieving clusters of homogeneous fiber architecture, performing classification with minimal annotations, and query-based retrieval of characteristic components of fiber architecture such as U-fibers.</p></details> | Journal version |
| **[Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning: The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.</p></details> | 43 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Graph Representational Learning: When Does More Expressivity Hurt Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11298v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning on structured data, yet the relationship between their expressivity and predictive performance remains unclear. We introduce a family of premetrics that capture different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by empirical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximizing Asynchronicity in Event-based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11165v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras deliver visual data with high temporal resolution, low latency, and minimal redundancy, yet their asynchronous, sparse sequential nature challenges standard tensor-based machine learning (ML). While the recent asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines, existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations. Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deviating from the prevailing paradigms of subword tokenizations and "one model to rule them all", AnnualBERT adopts whole words as tokens and is composed of a base RoBERTa model pretrained from scratch on the full-text of 1.7 million arXiv papers published until 2008 and a collection of progressively trained models on arXiv papers at an annual basis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AnnualBERT models by showing that they not only have comparable performances in standard tasks but also achieve state-of-the-art performances on domain-specific NLP tasks as well as link prediction tasks in the arXiv citation network. We then utilize probing tasks to quantify the models' behavior in terms of representation learning and forgetting as time progresses. Our approach enables the pretrained models to not only improve performances on scientific text processing tasks but also to provide insights into the development of scientific discourse over time.

We also introduce a retrieval system that leverages both musical features and metadata to identify similar songs, which are then used to fill in missing metadata using a local large language model (LLLM). This approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive and informative dataset for researchers working on music-language understanding tasks. We validate this approach quantitatively with five different measurements. By making the JamendoMaxCaps dataset publicly available, we provide a high-quality resource to advance research in music-language understanding tasks such as music retrieval, multimodal representation learning, and generative music models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[UniHR: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Unified Knowledge Graph Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07019v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond-triple fact representations including hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts implying relationships between facts, are gaining significant attention. However, constrained by complex fact representation forms, existing link prediction models for beyond-triple facts have difficulty achieving hierarchical fact modeling and generalizing the modules for one specific facts to other fact types. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework (UniHR) for unified knowledge graph link prediction. It consists of a unified Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module as graph encoder. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing the semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Lza12a/UniHR.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains vulnerable to information leakage during intermediate computation sharing. While Contrastive Federated Learning (CFL) was introduced to mitigate these privacy concerns through representation learning, it still faces challenges from gradient-based attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of gradient-based attacks in CFL environments and evaluates random client selection as a defensive strategy. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that random client selection proves particularly effective in defending against gradient attacks in the CFL network. Our findings provide valuable insights for implementing robust security measures in contrastive federated learning systems, contributing to the development of more secure collaborative learning frameworks</p></details> |  |

However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs.

| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | 18 pages,3 figuares |
| **[DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14609v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Search (CS) involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus while considering the conversational context, integrating retrieval with context modeling. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores between conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Furthermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMRL++: Parameter-Efficient and Interaction-Aware Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10088v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable, modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference, a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between task-specific adaptation and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 20.5 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</p></details> |  |

While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.

Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classification in multiclass settings. Digital twins of 5G networks increasingly employ graph classification as the main method for identifying failure types. However, the skewed distribution of failure occurrences is a significant class-imbalance problem that prevents practical graph data mining. Previous studies have not sufficiently addressed this complex problem. This paper, proposes class-Fourier GNN (CF-GNN) that introduces a class-oriented spectral filtering mechanism to ensure precise classification by estimating a unique spectral filter for each class. This work employs eigenvalue and eigenvector spectral filtering to capture and adapt to variations in minority classes, ensuring accurate class-specific feature discrimination, and adept at graph representation learning for complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting.

In this study, we present a novel approach utilizing radiogenomic data including structural MRI images and gene expression data, for Alzheimer's disease detection. Our framework introduces a novel heterogeneous bipartite graph representation learning featuring two distinct node types: genes and images. The network can effectively classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) into three distinct stages:AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitive Normal (CN) classes, utilizing a small dataset. Additionally, it identified which genes play a significant role in each of these classification groups. We evaluate the performance of our approach using metrics including classification accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The proposed technique holds potential for extending to radiogenomic-based classification to other diseases.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MDL-Pool: Adaptive Multilevel Graph Pooling Based on Minimum Description Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10263v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph pooling compresses graphs and summarises their topological properties and features in a vectorial representation. It is an essential part of deep graph representation learning and is indispensable in graph-level tasks like classification or regression. Current approaches pool hierarchical structures in graphs by iteratively applying shallow pooling operators up to a fixed depth. However, they disregard the interdependencies between structures at different hierarchical levels and do not adapt to datasets that contain graphs with different sizes that may require pooling with various depths. To address these issues, we propose MDL-Pool, a pooling operator based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, whose loss formulation explicitly models the interdependencies between different hierarchical levels and facilitates a direct comparison between multiple pooling alternatives with different depths. MDP-Pool builds on the map equation, an information-theoretic objective function for community detection, which naturally implements Occam's razor and balances between model complexity and goodness-of-fit via the MDL. We demonstrate MDL-Pool's competitive performance in an empirical evaluation against various baselines across standard graph classification datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components, in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is available at https://target-benchmark.github.io.</p></details> |  |

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Our architecture integrates pseudo-labels derived from generated textual prompts to guide implicit alignment of emotional semantics. To capture shared information across multi-views, we propose a joint embedding space that aligns multiview representations without requiring explicit supervision. We further enhance the discriminability of our model through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[OLinear: A Linear Model for Time Series Forecasting in Orthogonally Transformed Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08550v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an $\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series' temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer, $\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based forecasters.

Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGSSM: Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09017v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the dynamic graph representation learning methods involve dividing a dynamic graph into discrete snapshots to capture the evolving behavior of nodes over time. Existing methods primarily capture only local or global structures of each node within a snapshot using message-passing and random walk-based methods. Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to encode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques to update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations. First, they neglect the extraction of global and local information simultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's performance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a lack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to optimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address the aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we propose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM). Our approach combines Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) for local feature extraction and random walk with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for global feature extraction in each snapshot. We then integrate the local and global features using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate an SSM based on HiPPO algorithm to account for long-term dependencies when updating model parameters, ensuring that model performance in each snapshot informs subsequent updates. Experiments on five public datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 17 out of 20 cases.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era.

Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Early and accurate diagnosis of POD is critical and achievable. Here, we propose a POD prediction framework comprising a Transformer representation model followed by traditional machine learning algorithms. Our approaches utilizes multi-modal physiological data, including amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), vital signs, electrocardiographic monitor data as well as hemodynamic parameters. We curated the first multi-modal POD dataset encompassing two patient types and evaluated the various Transformer architectures for representation learning. Empirical results indicate a consistent improvements of sensitivity and Youden index in patient TYPE I using Transformer representations, particularly our fusion adaptation of Pathformer. By enabling effective delirium diagnosis from postoperative day 1 to 3, our extensive experimental findings emphasize the potential of multi-modal physiological data and highlight the necessity of representation learning via multi-modal Transformer architecture in clinical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Vision Transformers with Multi-Scale Causal Intervention for Long-Tailed Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08173v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we show that bounded GNN architectures correspond to specific fragments of first-order logic (FO), including modal logic (ML), graded modal logic (GML), modal logic with the universal modality (ML(A)), the two-variable fragment (FO2) and its extension with counting quantifiers (C2). To establish these results, we apply methods and tools from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. This provides a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 11 pages |

While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data.

| **[Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Most current methods stack spatial and temporal features in a straightforward way, which adds redundancy and still misses subtle joint-level cues. We introduce HiSTF Mamba, a framework with three parts: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba and a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). The Dual-Spatial module runs part-based and whole-body models in parallel, capturing both overall coordination and fine-grained joint motion. The Bi-Temporal module scans sequences forward and backward to encode short-term details and long-term dependencies. DSFM removes redundant temporal information, extracts complementary cues and fuses them with spatial features to build a richer spatiotemporal representation. Experiments on the HumanML3D benchmark show that HiSTF Mamba performs well across several metrics, achieving high fidelity and tight semantic alignment between text and motion.</p></details> | 15pages,5figures, |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms.

| **[AdaToken-3D: Dynamic Spatial Gating for Efficient 3D Large Multimodal-Models Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12782v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |

Although recent advances have improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering (JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts. Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers. We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figure |

In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches assume the availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.</p></details> |  |

In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, it's KDD'2025 under reviewing</p></details> |

We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets. The multimodal large language model (LLM) with the proposed training provides the best results among the investigated methods. We receive near state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UPMC Food-101 dataset.

Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines.

In this contribution, we identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 14pages |

Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Further analysis shows that using a lightweight ResNet18 backbone enhances classification performance, particularly under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures, 4 tables,Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare Proceedings of 13th KES-InMed 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |

Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.</p></details> |  |

However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Grounding for Efficient Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p></details> |  |

However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  |

However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/airliisc/IndraEye.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR-W PBVS 2025</p></details> |

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |
| **[IoT-AMLHP: Aligned Multimodal Learning of Header-Payload Representations for Resource-Efficient Malicious IoT Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14833v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification is crucial for securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEFT A2Z: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Survey for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14117v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.</p></details> | PEFT Survey paper |

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

| **[A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12796v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MMCLIP: Cross-modal Attention Masked Modelling for Medical Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19546v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Concept Modality Specific Datasets (CMSDs), which consist of data subsets categorized by the modality (visual, textual, or audio) of annotated concepts. Models trained on CMSDs outperform those using traditional legacy training in both early and late fusion approaches. Notably, this approach enables late fusion models to achieve performance close to that of early fusion models. These findings underscore the importance of modality-specific annotations in developing robust, self-explainable video models and contribute to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in complex video analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 Figures |

Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, submitted as a preprint.

Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> |

While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  |

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces.

Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |

While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion for Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21124v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of pathologic images and genomic data for survival analysis has gained increasing attention with advances in multimodal learning. However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22715v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding human emotions across diverse communication channels. While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

| **[Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18595v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/InfoReg_CVPR2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 16 figures, CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16858v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data. The dataset provides detailed annotations for seven distinct surficial geologic classes encompassing various geological processes. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline using open-sourced raw data and establish baseline benchmarks using different spatial modalities to demonstrate the utility of EarthScape. As a living dataset with a vision for expansion, EarthScape bridges the gap between computer vision and Earth sciences, offering a valuable resource for advancing research in multimodal learning, geospatial analysis, and geological mapping.

| **[Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning for Bridging Modality Gaps in Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14938v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification (FS-RSSC) presents the challenge of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning (OTAT) framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for advancing multimodal learning in remote sensing applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in FS-RSSC, significantly improving the model performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid 2025</p></details> |

The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously.

| **[Towards Generalization of Tactile Image Generation: Reference-Free Evaluation in a Leakage-Free Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06860v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing, which relies on direct physical contact, is critical for human perception and underpins applications in computer vision, robotics, and multimodal learning. Because tactile data is often scarce and costly to acquire, generating synthetic tactile images provides a scalable solution to augment real-world measurements. However, ensuring robust generalization in synthesizing tactile images-capturing subtle, material-specific contact features-remains challenging. We demonstrate that overlapping training and test samples in commonly used datasets inflate performance metrics, obscuring the true generalizability of tactile models. To address this, we propose a leakage-free evaluation protocol coupled with novel, reference-free metrics-TMMD, I-TMMD, CI-TMMD, and D-TMMD-tailored for tactile generation. Moreover, we propose a vision-to-touch generation method that leverages text as an intermediate modality by incorporating concise, material-specific descriptions during training to better capture essential tactile features. Experiments on two popular visuo-tactile datasets, Touch and Go and HCT, show that our approach achieves superior performance and enhanced generalization in a leakage-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17823v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 10 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |

Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating both textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in this space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as auxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based techniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text as input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning procedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique specially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to improve performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained with this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document image understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined with an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms larger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA also sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging document visual analysis benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GazeCLIP: Enhancing Gaze Estimation Through Text-Guided Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00260v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual gaze estimation, with its wide-ranging application scenarios, has garnered increasing attention within the research community. Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks. The implementation code and the pre-trained model will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

| **[BackdoorMBTI: A Backdoor Learning Multimodal Benchmark Tool Kit for Backdoor Defense Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11006v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented significant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert backdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

| **[MMBind: Unleashing the Potential of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data for Multimodal Learning in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12126v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sensing systems are increasingly prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new data binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We also propose a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data, coupled with an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying degrees of data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications\footnote (The source code is available via https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rebalanced Multimodal Learning with Data-aware Unimodal Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03792v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the modality learning degeneration caused by modality imbalance, existing multimodal learning~(MML) approaches primarily attempt to balance the optimization process of each modality from the perspective of model learning. However, almost all existing methods ignore the modality imbalance caused by unimodal data sampling, i.e., equal unimodal data sampling often results in discrepancies in informational content, leading to modality imbalance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel MML approach called \underline{D}ata-aware \underline{U}nimodal \underline{S}ampling~(\method), which aims to dynamically alleviate the modality imbalance caused by sampling. Specifically, we first propose a novel cumulative modality discrepancy to monitor the multimodal learning process. Based on the learning status, we propose a heuristic and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based data-aware unimodal sampling approaches to adaptively determine the quantity of sampled data at each iteration, thus alleviating the modality imbalance from the perspective of sampling. Meanwhile, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into almost all existing multimodal learning approaches as a plugin. Experiments demonstrate that \method~can achieve the best performance by comparing with diverse state-of-the-art~(SOTA) baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization via Self-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05933v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models. Our code will be released after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination therapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.</p></details> |  |

The efficiency of multimodal systems is a critical concern, given the varying costs and resource demands of different modalities. This underscores the necessity for effective modality selection to balance performance gains against resource expenditures. In this study, we propose a novel framework for modality selection that independently learns the representation of each modality. This approach allows for the assessment of each modality's significance within its unique representation space, enabling the development of tailored encoders and facilitating the joint analysis of modalities with distinct characteristics. Our framework aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal learning by optimizing modality integration and selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dementia Insights: A Context-Based MultiModal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01226v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affects memory, reasoning, and daily functioning, creating challenges for individuals and healthcare systems. Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy. By integrating multimodal learning with contextual embeddings, this work lays the foundation for future advancements in personalized dementia detection and cognitive health research.</p></details> |  |

While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

| **[Foundation-Model-Boosted Multimodal Learning for fMRI-based Neuropathic Pain Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00210v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal learning~(MML) has garnered remarkable progress, the existence of modality imbalance hinders multimodal learning from achieving its expected superiority over unimodal models in practice. To overcome this issue, mainstream multimodal learning methods have placed greater emphasis on balancing the learning process. However, these approaches do not explicitly enhance the classification ability of weaker modalities, leading to limited performance promotion. By designing a sustained boosting algorithm, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors using a designed configurable classifier module. Then, we propose an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of weak modality. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art~(SoTA) multimodal learning baselines.</p></details> |  |
