| **[Toward Continuous Neurocognitive Monitoring: Integrating Speech AI with Relational Graph Transformers for Rare Neurological Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04938v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patients with rare neurological diseases report cognitive symptoms -"brain fog"- invisible to traditional tests. We propose continuous neurocognitive monitoring via smartphone speech analysis integrated with Relational Graph Transformer (RELGT) architectures. Proof-of-concept in phenylketonuria (PKU) shows speech-derived "Proficiency in Verbal Discourse" correlates with blood phenylalanine (p = -0.50, p < 0.005) but not standard cognitive tests (all |r| < 0.35). RELGT could overcome information bottlenecks in heterogeneous medical data (speech, labs, assessments), enabling predictive alerts weeks before decompensation. Key challenges: multi-disease validation, clinical workflow integration, equitable multilingual deployment. Success would transform episodic neurology into continuous personalized monitoring for millions globally.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contract-Driven QoE Auditing for Speech and Singing Services: From MOS Regression to Service Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04827v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) remain the de-facto target for non-intrusive speech and singing quality assessment. However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified "simple" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC25')</p></details> |
| **[GAMA: A Neural Neighborhood Search Method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention for Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07850v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Graph Learning with Graph-Tuple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10341v4)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges, making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs, such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster at the TAG-DS 2025 Workshop (Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science).

| **[ST-Booster: An Iterative SpatioTemporal Perception Booster for Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09843v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to navigate unknown, continuous spaces based on natural language instructions. Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[scCluBench: Comprehensive Benchmarking of Clustering Algorithms for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02471v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell clustering is crucial for uncovering cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by identifying cell types and marker genes. Despite its importance, benchmarks for scRNA-seq clustering methods remain fragmented, often lacking standardized protocols and failing to incorporate recent advances in artificial intelligence. To fill these gaps, we present scCluBench, a comprehensive benchmark of clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data. First, scCluBench provides 36 scRNA-seq datasets collected from diverse public sources, covering multiple tissues, which are uniformly processed and standardized to ensure consistency for systematic evaluation and downstream analyses. To evaluate performance, we collect and reproduce a range of scRNA-seq clustering methods, including traditional, deep learning-based, graph-based, and biological foundation models. We comprehensively evaluate each method both quantitatively and qualitatively, using core performance metrics as well as visualization analyses. Furthermore, we construct representative downstream biological tasks, such as marker gene identification and cell type annotation, to further assess the practical utility. scCluBench then investigates the performance differences and applicability boundaries of various clustering models across diverse analytical tasks, systematically assessing their robustness and scalability in real-world scenarios. Overall, scCluBench offers a standardized and user-friendly benchmark for scRNA-seq clustering, with curated datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and transparent analyses, facilitating informed method selection and providing valuable insights into model generalizability and application scope.</p></details> |  |
| **[AtomGraph: Tackling Atomicity Violation in Smart Contracts using Multimodal GCNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02399v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are a core component of blockchain technology and are widely deployed across various scenarios. However, atomicity violations have become a potential security risk. Existing analysis tools often lack the precision required to detect these issues effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce AtomGraph, an automated framework designed for detecting atomicity violations. This framework leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to identify atomicity violations through multimodal feature learning and fusion. Specifically, driven by a collaborative learning mechanism, the model simultaneously learns from two heterogeneous modalities: extracting structural topological features from the contract's Control Flow Graph (CFG) and uncovering deep semantics from its opcode sequence. We designed an adaptive weighted fusion mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of features from each modality to achieve optimal feature fusion. Finally, GCN detects graph-level atomicity violation on the contract. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AtomGraph achieves 96.88% accuracy and 96.97% F1 score, outperforming existing tools. Furthermore, compared to the concatenation fusion model, AtomGraph improves the F1 score by 6.4%, proving its potential in smart contract security detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Scaffold: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Gradient Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01732v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01698v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |
| **[HiFIRec Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues,providing personalized services in domains such as healthcare and ecommerce.Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner,which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors.Especially,high frequency yet low intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals,and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading,thereby hindering the learning of user intentions.To this end,this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method,HiFIRec,that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling.To revise the noisy signals,we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross layer feature fusion.To correct plausible frequent patterns,we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples.Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Noise to Laws: Regularized Time-Series Forecasting via Denoised Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17817v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and MAE gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Dynamic Hidden Graph Structure in Heterogeneous Correlated Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01301v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling heterogeneous correlated time series requires the ability to learn hidden dynamic relationships between component time series with possibly varying periodicities and generative processes. To address this challenge, we formulate and evaluate a windowed variance-correlation metric (WVC) designed to quantify time-varying correlations between signals. This method directly recovers hidden relationships in an specified time interval as a weighted adjacency matrix, consequently inferring hidden dynamic graph structure. On simulated data, our method captures correlations that other methods miss. The proposed method expands the ability to learn dynamic graph structure between significantly different signals within a single cohesive dynamical graph model.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, Presented at BayLearn 2025</p></details> |
| **[Joint Partitioning and Placement of Foundation Models for Real-Time Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01039v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference over large-scale foundation models within heterogeneous edge environments necessitates a fundamentally reconfigurable orchestration substrate. Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Inspired Spectral Geometry for Neural Operator Equivalence and Structured Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00880v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of multimodal intelligence on resource-constrained and heterogeneous domestic hardware exposes critical bottlenecks: multimodal feature heterogeneity, real-time requirements in dynamic scenarios, and hardware-specific operator redundancy. This work introduces a quantum-inspired geometric framework for neural operators that represents each operator by its normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere. We prove a tight spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem showing that vanishing Fubini--Study/Wasserstein-2 distance implies provable functional closeness, establishing the first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability. Based on this metric, we propose Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and one-shot structured pruning. Controlled simulation validates the superiority of the proposed metric over magnitude and random baselines. An extensive experimental validation on large-scale multimodal transformers and domestic heterogeneous hardware (Huawei Ascend, Cambricon MLU, Kunlunxin) hardware is deferred to an extended journal version currently in preparation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, preliminary version; concepts and simulation experiments only</p></details> |
| **[Prediction-space knowledge markets for communication-efficient federated learning on multimedia tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00841v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training over distributed multimedia data but suffers acutely from statistical heterogeneity and communication constraints, especially when clients deploy large models. Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[FiCoTS: Fine-to-Coarse LLM-Enhanced Hierarchical Cross-Modality Interaction for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00293v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Textual and Structural Information for Premise Selection in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23637v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph capturing both state-premise and premise-premise relations. On the LeanDojo Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over 25\% across standard retrieval metrics. These results suggest that relational information is beneficial for premise selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-chain Graph Refinement and Selection for Reliable Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23136v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a critical bottleneck for their practical applications. Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%. Remarkably, on the 24-point game, MGRS attains 100% accuracy for the first time, while delivering a 13.6x speed-up compared to the leading Forest of Thoughts framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Constrained Optimization for Cloud Application Deployment via Graph Neural Networks and Satisfiability Modulo Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23109v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel hybrid neuro-symbolic framework for the optimal and scalable deployment of component-based applications in the Cloud. The challenge of efficiently mapping application components to virtual machines (VMs) across diverse VM Offers from Cloud Providers is formalized as a constrained optimization problem (COP), considering both general and application-specific constraints. Due to the NP-hard nature and scalability limitations of exact solvers, we introduce a machine learning-enhanced approach where graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on small-scale deployment instances and their predictions are used as soft constraints within the Z3 SMT solver. The deployment problem is recast as a graph edge classification task over a heterogeneous graph, combining relational embeddings with constraint reasoning. Our framework is validated through several realistic case studies, each highlighting different constraint profiles. Experimental results confirm that incorporating GNN predictions improves solver scalability and often preserves or even improves cost-optimality. This work demonstrates the practical benefits of neuro-symbolic coupling for Cloud infrastructure planning and contributes a reusable methodology for general NP-hard problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Rank Critical Road Segments via Heterogeneous Graphs with OD Flow Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19199v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing learning-to-rank methods for road networks often fail to incorporate origin-destination (OD) flows and route information, limiting their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. To address this gap, we propose HetGL2R, a heterogeneous graph learning framework for ranking road-segment importance. HetGL2R builds a tripartite graph that unifies OD flows, routes, and network topology, and further introduces attribute-guided graphs that elevate node attributes into explicit nodes to model functional similarity. A heterogeneous joint random walk algorithm (HetGWalk) samples both graph types to generate context-rich node sequences. These sequences are encoded with a Transformer to learn embeddings that capture long-range structural dependencies driven by OD demand and route configuration, as well as functional associations derived from attribute similarity. Finally, a listwise ranking strategy with a KL-divergence loss evaluates and ranks segment importance. Experiments on three SUMO-generated simulated networks of different scales show that, against state-of-the-art methods, HetGL2R achieves average improvements of approximately 7.52%, 4.40% and 3.57% in ranking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Big Wins, Small Net Gains: Direct and Spillover Effects of First Industry Entries in Puerto Rico](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19469v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I study how first sizable industry entries reshape local and neighboring labor markets in Puerto Rico. Using over a decade of quarterly municipality--industry data (2014Q1--2025Q1), I identify ``first sizable entries'' as large, persistent jumps in establishments, covered employment, and wage bill, and treat these as shocks to local industry presence at the municipio--industry level. Methodologically, I combine staggered-adoption difference-in-differences estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment timing with an imputation-based event-study approach, and I use a doubly robust difference-in-differences framework that explicitly allows for interference through pre-specified exposure mappings on a contiguity graph. The estimates show large and persistent direct gains in covered employment and wage bill in the treated municipality--industry cells over 0--16 quarters. Same-industry neighbors experience sizable short-run gains that reverse over the medium run, while within-municipality cross-industry and neighbor all-industries spillovers are small and imprecisely estimated. Once these spillovers are taken into account and spatially robust inference and sensitivity checks are applied, the net regional 0--16 quarter effect on covered employment is positive but modest in magnitude and estimated with considerable uncertainty. The results imply that first sizable entries generate substantial local gains where they occur, but much smaller and less precisely measured net employment gains for the broader regional economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial spillovers when evaluating place-based policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoTailor: Automatic and Efficient Adaptive Model Deployment for Diverse Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22355v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device machine learning (ML) has become a fundamental component of emerging mobile applications. Adaptive model deployment delivers efficient inference for heterogeneous device capabilities and performance requirements through customizing neural architectures. SuperNet-based approaches offer a promising solution by generating a large number of model variants from a pre-trained ML model. However, applying SuperNet in existing frameworks suffers from tedious model-aware development and time-consuming hardware-aware profiling, which limits their practical adoption. We present AutoTailor, the first framework to enable automated, end-to-end SuperNet-based adaptive model deployment for edge devices. Unlike manual SuperNet construction, AutoTailor employs a computation graph-guided compilation approach to automatically transform user-provided ML models into SuperNets. To support efficient specialization, AutoTailor incorporates learning-free latency and accuracy predictors, enabling low-cost yet accurate performance prediction. Our extended evaluations demonstrate that AutoTailor reduces the lines of code for SuperNet construction by 11--27$\times$, decreases hardware-aware profiling costs by at least 11$\times$, and achieves up to 15.60\% absolute accuracy improvement and 60.03\% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches across diverse models and devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[IVGAE: Handling Incomplete Heterogeneous Data with a Variational Graph Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22116v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling missing data remains a fundamental challenge in real-world tabular datasets, especially when data are heterogeneous with both numerical and categorical features. Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex structural dependencies and handle heterogeneous data effectively. We present \textbf{IVGAE}, a Variational Graph Autoencoder framework for robust imputation of incomplete heterogeneous data. IVGAE constructs a bipartite graph to represent sample-feature relationships and applies graph representation learning to model structural dependencies. A key innovation is its \textit{dual-decoder architecture}, where one decoder reconstructs feature embeddings and the other models missingness patterns, providing structural priors aware of missing mechanisms. To better encode categorical variables, we introduce a Transformer-based heterogeneous embedding module that avoids high-dimensional one-hot encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets show that IVGAE achieves consistent improvements in RMSE and downstream F1 across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing scenarios under 30\% missing rates.

However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM Guided Semantic and Motion Changed Region Mining for Remote Sensing Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21420v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAM_ChangeCaptioning</p></details> |  |
| **[CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-branch Spatial-Temporal Self-supervised Representation for Enhanced Road Network Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06633v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI 2026 |
| **[Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18493v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AirFed: A Federated Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-UAV Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23053v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning, task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2% IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%. Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers, IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Transformer-Based Models on Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Graphs for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20704v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.</p></details> | 14 pages.

| **[HeLEx: A Heterogeneous Layout Explorer for Spatial Elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19366v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HeLEx, a framework for determining the functional layout of heterogeneous spatially-configured elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs). Given a collection of input data flow graphs (DFGs) and a target CGRA, the framework starts with a full layout in which every processing element (PE) supports every operation in the DFGs. It then employs a branch-and-bound (BB) search to eliminate operations out of PEs, ensuring that the input DFGs successfully map onto the resulting CGRAs, eventually returning an optimized heterogeneous CGRA. Experimental evaluation with 12 DFGs and 9 target CGRA sizes reveals that the framework reduces the number of operations by 68.7% on average, resulting in a reduction of CGRA area by almost 70% and of power by over 51%, all compared to the initial full layout. HeLEx generates CGRAs that are on average only within 6.2% of theoretically minimum CGRAs that support exactly the number of operations needed by the input DFGs. A comparison with functional layouts produced by two state-of-the-art frameworks indicates that HeLEx achieves better reduction in the number of operations, by up to 2.6X.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphMind: Theorem Selection and Conclusion Generation Framework with Dynamic GNN for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19078v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanizing a Proof-Relevant Logical Relation for Timed Message-Passing Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19521v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic typing has become a powerful tool for program verification, applying the technique of logical relations as not only a proof method, but also a device for prescribing program behavior. In recent work, Yao et al. scaled semantic typing to the verification of timed message-passing protocols, which are prevalent in, e.g., IoT and real-time systems applications. The appeal of semantic typing in this context is precisely because of its ability to support typed and untyped program components alike -- including physical objects -- which caters to the heterogeneity of these applications. Another demand inherent to these applications is timing: constraining the time or time window within which a message exchange must happen. Yao et al. equipped their logical relation not only with temporal predicates, but also with computable trajectories, to supply the evidence that an inhabitant can step from one time point to another one. While Yao et al. provide the formalization for such a verification tool, it lacks a mechanization. Mechanizing the system would not only provide a machine proof for it, but also facilitate scalability for future extensions and applications. This paper tackles the challenge of mechanizing the resulting proof-relevant logical relation in a proof assistant. allowing trajectories to be interleaved, partitioned, and concatenated, while the intended equality on trajectories is the equality of their graphs when seen as processes indexed by time. Unfortunately, proof assistants based on intensional type theory only have modest support for such equations, forcing a prolific use of transports. This paper reports on the process of mechanizing Yao et al.'s results, comprising the logical relation, the algebra of computable trajectories with supporting lemmas, and the fundamental theorem of the logical relation, in the Rocq theorem prover.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 KG...</summary><p>15 KG pipelines (9 single source, 6 multi source)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient LLM-aware Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17923v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoGraphAD: A novel approach using Variational Graph Autoencoders for anomalous network flow detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17113v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools for detecting network attacks and intrusions. While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often underperform in practical scenarios where data are noisy, incomplete, or drawn from a different distribution than the training data. To address this, we propose Uni-Adapter, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs, improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs. Project page: https://mehran-tam.github.io/Uni-Adapter</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination" issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 40 references</p></details> |

Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines.

However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  |

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation. In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics. Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

The framework consists of four key stages designed to capture prognostic and morphological heterogeneity. First, a Quantile Based Patch Filtering module selects prognostically informative tissue regions through quantile thresholding. Second, Graph Regularized Patch Clustering models phenotype level variations using a k nearest neighbor graph that enforces spatial and morphological coherence. Third, Hierarchical Feature Aggregation learns both intra and inter cluster dependencies to represent multiscale tumor organization. Finally, an Expert Guided Mixture Density Model estimates complex survival distributions via Gaussian mixtures, enabling fine grained risk prediction. Evaluated on TCGA LUAD, TCGA KIRC, and TCGA BRCA cohorts, our model achieves concordance indices of 0.653 ,0.719 ,and 0.733 respectively, surpassing existing state of the art approaches in survival prediction from WSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices. We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\ln{k} / \sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[UGG-ReID: Uncertainty-Guided Graph Model for Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04638v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous visual data sources. At present, multi-modal object ReID faces two core challenges: (1) learning robust features under fine-grained local noise caused by occlusion, frame loss, and other disruptions; and (2) effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities to enhance multi-modal representation. To address the above challenges, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction, improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code is available at https://github.com/wanxixi11/UGG-ReID.</p></details> |  |

For these reasons, accurate forecasting and modeling of ionospheric variability has become increasingly relevant. To address this gap, we present IonCast, a suite of deep learning models that include a GraphCast-inspired model tailored for ionospheric dynamics. IonCast leverages spatiotemporal learning to forecast global Total Electron Content (TEC), integrating diverse physical drivers and observational datasets. Validating on held-out storm-time and quiet conditions highlights improved skill compared to persistence. By unifying heterogeneous data with scalable graph-based spatiotemporal learning, IonCast demonstrates how machine learning can augment physical understanding of ionospheric variability and advance operational space weather resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Resource-Based Time and Cost Prediction in Project Networks: From Statistical Modeling to Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15003v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of project duration and cost remains one of the most challenging aspects of project management, particularly in resource-constrained and interdependent task networks. Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies. We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks. Furthermore, the learned embeddings provide interpretable insights into resource bottlenecks and critical dependencies, enabling more explainable and adaptive scheduling decisions.</p></details> | 52 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A County-Level Similarity Network of Electric Vehicle Adoption: Integrating Predictive Modeling and Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14999v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is essential for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), which account for nearly half of transportation-related emissions in the United States. Yet regional EV adoption varies widely, and prior studies often overlook county-level heterogeneity by relying on broad state-level analyses or limited city samples. Such approaches risk masking local patterns and may lead to inaccurate or non-transferable policy recommendations. This study introduces a graph-theoretic framework that complements predictive modeling to better capture how county-level characteristics relate to EV adoption. Feature importances from multiple predictive models are averaged and used as weights within a weighted Gower similarity metric to construct a county similarity network. A mutual k-nearest-neighbors procedure and modularity-based community detection identify 27 clusters of counties with similar weighted feature profiles. EV adoption rates are then analyzed across clusters, and standardized effect sizes (Cohens d) highlight the most distinguishing features for each cluster. Findings reveal consistent global trends, such as declining median income, educational attainment, and charging-station availability across lower adoption tiers; while also uncovering important local variations that general trend or prediction analyses fail to capture. In particular, some low-adoption groups are rural but not economically disadvantaged, whereas others are urbanized yet experience high poverty rates, demonstrating that different mechanisms can lead to the same adoption outcome. By exposing both global structural patterns and localized deviations, this framework provides policymakers with actionable, cluster-specific insights for designing more effective and context-sensitive EV adoption strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Greenland Bed Topography Mapping with Uncertainty-Aware Graph Learning on Sparse Radar Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08571v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization. Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation, convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable knowledge at continental scale.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Construction of Medical Indicator Knowledge Graphs Using Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13526v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern healthcare by advancing disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and biomedical research. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

Peirce's Manuscripts with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13378v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tab-PET: Graph-Based Positional Encodings for Tabular Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13338v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a comprehensive computational pathology framework that addresses these limitations through four complementary innovations: (1) Quantile-Gated Patch Selection for dynamically identifying prognostically relevant regions, (2) Graph-Guided Clustering to group patches by spatial and morphological similarity, (3) Hierarchical Context Attention to model both local tissue interactions and global slide-level context, and (4) an Expert-Driven Mixture of Log-Logistics module that flexibly models complex survival distributions. Across large TCGA cohorts, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding time-dependent concordance indices of 0.644 on LUAD, 0.751 on KIRC, and 0.752 on BRCA, consistently outperforming both histology-only and multimodal baselines. The framework further provides improved calibration and interpretability, advancing the use of WSIs for personalized cancer prognosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Final-Stage Bottleneck: A Systematic Dissection of the R-Learner for Network Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13018v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic "representation bottleneck": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent "nuisance bottleneck," linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted "Hub-Periphery Trade-off" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical "final-stage bottleneck."</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Conversational Recommender Systems with Tree-Structured Knowledge and Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12579v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Decentralized Root Cause Localization Approach for Edge Computing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12486v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing environments host increasingly complex microservice-based IoT applications, which are prone to performance anomalies that can propagate across dependent services. Identifying the true source of such anomalies, known as Root Cause Localization (RCL), is essential for timely mitigation. However, existing RCL approaches are designed for cloud environments and rely on centralized analysis, which increases latency and communication overhead when applied at the edge. This paper proposes a decentralized RCL approach that executes localization directly at the edge device level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm. The proposed method first groups microservices into communication- and colocation-aware clusters, thereby confining most anomaly propagation within cluster boundaries. Within each cluster, PPR is executed locally to identify the root cause, significantly reducing localization time. For the rare cases where anomalies propagate across clusters, we introduce an inter-cluster peer-to-peer approximation process, enabling lightweight coordination among clusters with minimal communication overhead. To enhance the accuracy of localization in heterogeneous edge environments, we also propose a novel anomaly scoring mechanism tailored to the diverse anomaly triggers that arise across microservice, device, and network layers. Evaluation results on the publicly available edge dataset, MicroCERCL, demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approach achieves comparable or higher localization accuracy than its centralized counterpart while reducing localization time by up to 34%. These findings highlight that decentralized graph-based RCL can provide a practical and efficient solution for anomaly diagnosis in resource-constrained edge environments.</p></details> |  |

A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

While supervised methods achieve strong performance, their reliance on extensive pairwise annotations limits scalability. Unsupervised alternatives avoid annotation costs but suffer from noisy pseudo-labels due to intrinsic cross-view domain gaps. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{UniABG}$, a novel dual-stage unsupervised cross-view geo-localization framework integrating adversarial view bridging with graph-based correspondence calibration. Our approach first employs View-Aware Adversarial Bridging (VAAB) to model view-invariant features and enhance pseudo-label robustness. Subsequently, Heterogeneous Graph Filtering Calibration (HGFC) refines cross-view associations by constructing dual inter-view structure graphs, achieving reliable view correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art unsupervised performance, showing that UniABG improves Satellite $\rightarrow$ Drone AP by +10.63\% on University-1652 and +16.73\% on SUES-200, even surpassing supervised baselines.

We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks.

| **[MicroVQA++: High-Quality Microscopy Reasoning Dataset with Weakly Supervised Graphs for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11407v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Attributed Graph Learning via Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11245v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Diffusion Signals Reveal Hidden Connections: A Physics-Inspired Framework for Link Prediction via Personalized PageRank Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17569v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction in complex networks--identifying the missing or future connections--remains a cornerstone problem for understanding network evolution and function, yet existing methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with theoretical rigor across heterogeneous topologies. This work introduces a physically principled framework, Diffusion Distance with Personalized PageRank (D-PPR), which unifies static topology with dynamic information flow by modeling nodes as signal sources propagating through the network via Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors. The method quantifies node-pair similarity through the graph Laplacian-governed diffusion distance between their topology-aware signal distributions, thereby bridging microscopic interactions with macroscopic network dynamics. Systematic benchmarking on synthetic (Barabási-Albert, LFR) and seven large-scale real-world networks spanning technology, biology, and social domains demonstrates that D-PPR achieves highly competitive performance, yielding favorable results when compared to representative local and global heuristics, particularly in sparse and modular networks. These findings establish a rigorous foundation for physics-inspired link prediction by revealing that incorporating dynamical processes into structural similarity metrics enables deeper insights into network connectivity patterns, offering both methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives on the interplay between topology and dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echoless Label-Based Pre-computation for Memory-Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11081v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Graph Attention Network for Predicting Duration of Large-Scale Power Outages Induced by Natural Disasters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10898v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including texts, tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Yet it remains unclear whether such biases are systematic, which data-level factors drive them, and what internal mechanisms underlie their emergence. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of format bias in LLMs through a three-stage empirical analysis. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage examines how key data-level factors influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its effectiveness. Our results show that format bias is consistent across model families, driven by information richness, structure quality, and representation type, and is closely associated with attention imbalance within the LLMs. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: enhancing data pre-processing through format repair and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026, camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[Urban Incident Prediction with Graph Neural Networks: Integrating Government Ratings and Crowdsourced Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08740v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting, government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect, standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139 types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however, challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries, strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW. Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance; especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical Path Aware Timing-Driven Global Placement for Large-Scale Heterogeneous FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00038v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timing optimization during global placement is critical for achieving optimal circuit performance and remains a key challenge in modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design. As FPGA designs scale and heterogeneous resources increase, dense interconnects introduce significant resistive and capacitive effects, making timing closure increasingly difficult. Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2). Its code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeatV2X: Scalable Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Efficient Alignment and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10211v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

While spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics capture molecular features, they lack pathological morphological context. Integrating these omics with histopathological images is therefore essential for comprehensive disease tissue analysis. However, substantial heterogeneity across omics, imaging, and spatial modalities poses significant challenges. Naive fusion of semantically distinct sources often leads to ambiguous representations. Additionally, the resolution mismatch between high-resolution histology images and lower-resolution sequencing spots complicates spatial alignment. Biological perturbations during sample preparation further distort modality-specific signals, hindering accurate integration. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-guided Representation of Omics and Vision with Expert Regulation for Adaptive Spatial Multi-omics Fusion (GROVER), a novel framework for adaptive integration of spatial multi-omics data. GROVER leverages a Graph Convolutional Network encoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies between each modality and its associated spatial structure, thereby producing expressive, modality-specific embeddings. To align these representations, we introduce a spot-feature-pair contrastive learning strategy that explicitly optimizes the correspondence across modalities at each spot. Furthermore, we design a dynamic expert routing mechanism that adaptively selects informative modalities for each spot while suppressing noisy or low-quality inputs. Experiments on real-world spatial omics datasets demonstrate that GROVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing a robust and reliable solution for multimodal integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[AI-Integrated Decision Support System for Real-Time Market Growth Forecasting and Multi-Source Content Diffusion Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09962v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning for Connectome Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05109v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |

Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations. Preliminary results are encouraging, suggesting that LLM Chemistry-guided collaboration may offer a promising path toward reliable and trustworthy AI assistants in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[Dataset creation for supervised deep learning-based analysis of microscopic images -- review of important considerations and recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04564v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised deep learning (DL) receives great interest for automated analysis of microscopic images with an increasing body of literature supporting its potential. The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three "C"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research. By addressing the challenges and offering practical recommendations, this review aims to advance the creation of and availability to high-quality, large-scale datasets, ultimately contributing to the development of generalizable and robust DL models for pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of machine learning models in recommender systems has raised significant concerns regarding user privacy and security. As compliance with privacy regulations becomes more critical, there is a pressing need to address the issue of recommendation unlearning, i.e., eliminating the memory of specific training data from the learned recommendation models. Despite its importance, traditional machine unlearning methods are ill-suited for recommendation unlearning due to the unique challenges posed by collaborative interactions and model parameters. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in recommendation unlearning, exploring the design principles, challenges, and methodologies associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different recommendation unlearning approaches, followed by a summary of widely used benchmarks and metrics for evaluation. By reviewing the current state of research, this survey aims to guide the development of more efficient, scalable, and robust recommendation unlearning techniques. Furthermore, we identify open research questions in this field, which could pave the way for future innovations not only in recommendation unlearning but also in a broader range of unlearning tasks across different machine learning applications.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |
| **[LLM as Explainable Re-Ranker for Recommendation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03439v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation systems has recently gained traction. Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of integrating traditional recommendation models with LLMs to address limitations in existing systems and pave the way for more explainable and fair recommendation frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multimodal Search and Recommendation with Small Language Models via Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09854v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate how small language models (SLMs) can be scaled to support multimodal search and recommendation use cases while remaining efficient enough for real-time, resource-constrained deployments. We present a framework that combines upside-down reinforcement learning with synthetic data distillation from a large language model (Llama-3) to train a 100M-parameter GPT-2 model for multitask prompt generation. Despite being up to 80 times smaller than state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), our SLM achieves relevance and diversity scores within 6% of competitive baselines such as Llama-3 8B, Qwen3 8B, and Ministral 8B. These results demonstrate that SLMs can effectively handle multimodal search and recommendation tasks, while dramatically reducing inference latency and memory overhead. Our study highlights the potential of lightweight models as practical engines for scalable multimodal discovery, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world multimodal applications such as media recommendations and creative content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025 MMSR</p></details> |
| **[Data-Semantics-Aware Recommendation of Diverse Pivot Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06171v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification. We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attack against Large Language Model-based Recommendation Systems: A New Distillation-based Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14763v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership Inference Attack (MIA) aims to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the training dataset of a target model. Traditional MIA approaches rely on shadow models to mimic target model behavior, but their effectiveness diminishes for Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems due to the scale and complexity of training data. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm tailored for LLM-based recommendation systems. Our method constructs a reference model via distillation, applying distinct strategies for member and non-member data to enhance discriminative capabilities. The paradigm extracts fused features (e.g., confidence, entropy, loss, and hidden layer vectors) from the reference model to train an attack model, overcoming limitations of individual features. Extensive experiments on extended datasets (Last.FM, MovieLens, Book-Crossing, Delicious) and diverse LLMs (T5, GPT-2, LLaMA3) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms shadow model-based MIAs and individual-feature baselines. The results show its practicality for privacy attacks in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AskNearby: An LLM-Based Application for Neighborhood Information Retrieval and Personalized Cognitive-Map Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02502v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "15-minute city" envisions neighborhoods where residents can meet daily needs via a short walk or bike ride. Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-BERT4Rec: Quantized Semantic-ID Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02474v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation plays a critical role in modern online platforms such as e-commerce, advertising, and content streaming, where accurately predicting users' next interactions is essential for personalization. Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD2026 |

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\%-11.59\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to some internal company policies, we need to temporarily withdraw the paper.

However, the quality and reliability of these reviews can vary significantly. Some reviews contain misleading or unhelpful information, such as advertisements, fake content, or irrelevant details. These issues pose significant challenges for recommendation systems, which rely on user-generated reviews to provide personalized suggestions. This article introduces a recommendation system based on Passer Learning Optimization-enhanced Bi-LSTM classifier applicable to e-commerce recommendation systems with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves as low as 1.24% MSE on the baby dataset. This lifts it as high as 88.58%. Besides, there is also robust performance of the system on digital music and patio lawn garden datasets at F1 of 88.46% and 92.51%, correspondingly. These results, made possible by advanced graph embedding for effective knowledge extraction and fine-tuning of classifier parameters, establish the suitability of the proposed model in various e-commerce environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figuers, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[HiFIRec Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues,providing personalized services in domains such as healthcare and ecommerce.Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner,which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors.Especially,high frequency yet low intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals,and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading,thereby hindering the learning of user intentions.To this end,this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method,HiFIRec,that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling.To revise the noisy signals,we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross layer feature fusion.To correct plausible frequent patterns,we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples.Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Method to Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13632v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster and Memory-Efficient Training of Sequential Recommendation Models for Large Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09682v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendations (SR) with transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in real-world applications, where SR models require frequent retraining to adapt to ever-changing user preferences. However, training transformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost associated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of items. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak memory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length. Recognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems typically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss with negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the final layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model performance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of negative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance, but rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb). In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient implementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates training by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10 times. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training, it becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item catalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss functions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related hyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these factors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and batch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To facilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that efficiently implements the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Feature Selection Method for Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits in Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13888v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective feature selection is essential for optimizing contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) in large-scale online systems, where suboptimal features can degrade rewards, interpretability, and efficiency. Traditional feature selection often prioritizes outcome correlation, neglecting the crucial role of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) across arms in CMAB decision-making. This paper introduces two novel, model-free filter methods, Heterogeneous Incremental Effect (HIE) and Heterogeneous Distribution Divergence (HDD), specifically designed to identify features driving HTE. HIE quantifies a feature's value based on its ability to induce changes in the optimal arm, while HDD measures its impact on reward distribution divergence across arms. These methods are computationally efficient, robust to model mis-specification, and adaptable to various feature types, making them suitable for rapid screening in dynamic environments where retraining complex models is infeasible. We validate HIE and HDD on synthetic data with known ground truth and in a large-scale commercial recommender system, demonstrating their consistent ability to identify influential HTE features and thereby enhance CMAB performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProEx: A Unified Framework Leveraging Large Language Model with Profile Extrapolation for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00679v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful text understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have brought new vitality to general recommendation with implicit feedback. One possible strategy involves generating a unique user (or item) profile from historical interaction data, which is then mapped to a semantic representation in the language space. However, a single-instance profile may be insufficient to comprehensively capture the complex intentions behind a user's interacted items. Moreover, due to the inherent instability of LLMs, a biased or misinterpreted profile could even undermine the original recommendation performance. Consequently, an intuitive solution is to generate multiple profiles for each user (or item), each reflecting a distinct aspect of their characteristics. In light of this, we propose a unified recommendation framework with multi-faceted profile extrapolation (ProEx) in this paper. By leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, we construct multiple distinct profiles for each user and item. These new profiles are subsequently mapped into semantic vectors, extrapolating from the position of the original profile to explore a broader region of the language space. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of environments, where each environment represents a possible linear combination of all profiles. The differences across environments are minimized to reveal the inherent invariance of user preferences. We apply ProEx to three discriminative methods and three generative methods, and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ProEx significantly enhances the performance of these base recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2026 (First Cycle)</p></details> |

Treating these features as static inputs decouples them from the core recommendation task. We address this limitation with a novel framework built on a key insight: deeply fusing multi-modal and collaborative knowledge for representation denoising. Our unified architecture introduces two primary technical innovations. First, we integrate dimensionality reduction directly into the recommendation model, enabling end-to-end co-training that makes the reduction process aware of the final ranking objective. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the collaborative filtering signal into the latent space. This synergistic process refines raw LLM embeddings, filtering noise while amplifying task-relevant signals. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superior discriminative power, proving that this integrated fusion and denoising strategy is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our work provides a foundational paradigm for effectively harnessing LLMs in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling for Trade-off Optimization in Short-Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18997v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of short videos on social media platforms presents unique challenges and opportunities for recommendation systems. Users exhibit diverse preferences, and the responses resulting from different strategies often conflict with one another, potentially exhibiting inverse correlations between metrics such as watch time and video view counts. Existing uplift models face limitations in handling the heterogeneous multi-treatment scenarios of short-video recommendations, often failing to effectively capture both the synergistic and individual causal effects of different strategies. Furthermore, traditional fixed-weight approaches for balancing these responses lack personalization and can result in biased decision-making. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling (HMUM) framework for trade-off optimization in short-video recommendations. HMUM comprises an Offline Hybrid Uplift Modeling (HUM) module, which captures the synergistic and individual effects of multiple strategies, and an Online Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) module, which estimates the value weights of different user responses in real-time for personalized decision-making. Evaluated on two public datasets, an industrial dataset, and through online A/B experiments on the Kuaishou platform, our model demonstrated superior offline performance and significant improvements in key metrics. It is now fully deployed on the platform, benefiting hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2026 |

In contrast, textual document retrieval benefits from robust, standardized evaluation via Cranfield-style test collections, which combine pooled relevance judgments with controlled setups. While recent work shows that adapting this methodology to recommender systems is feasible, constructing such collections remains costly due to the need for manual relevance judgments, thus limiting scalability. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as reliable automatic judges to address these scalability challenges. Using the ML-32M-ext Cranfield-style movie recommendation collection, we first examine the limitations of existing evaluation methodologies. Then we explore the alignment and the recommender systems ranking agreement between the LLM-judge and human provided relevance labels. We find that incorporating richer item metadata and longer user histories improves alignment, and that LLM-judge yields high agreement with human-based rankings (Kendall's tau = 0.87). Finally, an industrial case study in the podcast recommendation domain demonstrates the practical value of LLM-judge for model selection. Overall, our results show that LLM-judge is a viable and scalable approach for evaluating recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, user embeddings in FedRecs often encode sensitive attribute information, rendering them vulnerable to attribute inference attacks. Attribute unlearning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we focus on user-level FedRecs, which is a more practical yet challenging setting compared to group-level FedRecs. Adversarial training emerges as the most feasible approach within this context. We identify two key challenges in implementing adversarial training-based attribute unlearning for user-level FedRecs: i) mitigating training instability caused by user data heterogeneity, and ii) preventing attribute information leakage through gradients. To address these challenges, we propose FedAU2, an attribute unlearning method for user-level FedRecs. For CH1, we propose an adaptive adversarial training strategy, where the training dynamics are adjusted in response to local optimization behavior. For CH2, we propose a dual-stochastic variational autoencoder to perturb the adversarial model, effectively preventing gradient-based information leakage. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedAU2 achieves superior performance in unlearning effectiveness and recommendation performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoFiRec: Coarse-to-Fine Tokenization for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22707v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In web environments, user preferences are often refined progressively as users move from browsing broad categories to exploring specific items. However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/YennNing/CoFiRec.</p></details> |  |

RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely. These results highlight that no single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; instead, each provides trade-offs under different privacy regimes and data conditions.</p></details> |  |

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selecting User Histories to Generate LLM Users for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21989v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and simulating human-like behavior across a wide range of tasks. These strengths present new opportunities to enhance traditional recommendation systems (RS), especially in the cold-start item scenario where newly introduced items lack interactions. Existing works have used LLMs to address cold-start issues in traditional RS through data augmentation, but they have limitations. One recent work directly addresses this issue by prompting LLMs to generate augmented interaction data between randomly sampled users and cold-start items. Then, they train the traditional RS with augmented data, incorporating collaborative signals for cold-start items. Although they use LLMs to provide cold-start items with feedback, they use partial user histories, which does not allow the LLM to fully emulate the user. Furthermore, randomly selecting users is not optimal for augmentation. To address these challenges, we leverage the LLM as a user and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains a policy to select users for augmentation, optimizing for cold-start item performance after augmented training. The policy model learns to select users for cold-start item data augmentation based on their behavioral features and histories. To optimize user selection for cold-start item performance, we employ a policy gradient method that updates the policy in the direction of actions that lead to high rewards. Experiments on Amazon Product Review datasets show substantial gains in cold-start item recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method as a scalable, serving-efficient augmentation strategy for modern RS.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |

A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA). The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 18th International Conference on Multi-disciplinary Trends in Artificial Intelligence (MIWAI 2025)</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p></details> |  |

Given that users' complex and intertwined periodic preferences are difficult to disentangle in the time domain, recent research is exploring frequency domain analysis to identify these hidden patterns. However, current frequency-domain-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) They primarily employ static filters with fixed characteristics, overlooking the personalized nature of behavioral patterns; (ii) While the global discrete Fourier transform excels at modeling long-range dependencies, it can blur non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, it consists of two vital modules: dynamic frequency-domain filtering and wavelet feature enhancement. The former is used to dynamically adjust filtering operations based on behavioral sequences to extract personalized global information, and the latter integrates wavelet transform to reconstruct sequences, enhancing blurred non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. Finally, these two modules work to achieve comprehensive performance and efficiency optimization in long sequential recommendation scenarios. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Learned Item Shortcuts for Sequential Recommendation (LISRec), a novel framework that explicitly captures stable preferences by extracting personalized semantic shortcuts from historical interactions. LISRec first learns task-agnostic semantic representations to assess item similarities, then constructs a personalized semantic graph over all user-interacted items. By identifying the maximal semantic connectivity subset within this graph, LISRec selects the most representative items as semantic shortcuts to guide user preference modeling. This focused representation filters out irrelevant actions while preserving the diversity of genuine interests. Experimental results on the Yelp and Amazon Product datasets illustrate that LISRec achieves a 13% improvement over baseline recommendation models, showing its effectiveness in capturing stable user interests. Further analysis indicates that shortcut-based histories better capture user preferences, making more accurate and relevant recommendations.

| **[A Probabilistic Framework for Temporal Distribution Generalization in Industry-Scale Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21032v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

| **[Efficient Model-Agnostic Continual Learning for Next POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08941v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2026 |
| **[Personalized Image Generation for Recommendations Beyond Catalogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18477v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization is central to human-AI interaction, yet current diffusion-based image generation systems remain largely insensitive to user diversity. Existing attempts to address this often rely on costly paired preference data or introduce latency through Large Language Models. In this work, we introduce REBECA (REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs), a lightweight and scalable framework for personalized image generation that learns directly from implicit feedback signals such as likes, ratings, and clicks. Instead of fine-tuning the underlying diffusion model, REBECA employs a two-stage process: training a conditional diffusion model to sample user- and rating-specific image embeddings, which are subsequently decoded into images using a pretrained diffusion backbone. This approach enables efficient, fine-tuning-free personalization across large user bases. We rigorously evaluate REBECA on real-world datasets, proposing a novel statistical personalization verifier and a permutation-based hypothesis test to assess preference alignment. Our results demonstrate that REBECA consistently produces high-fidelity images tailored to individual tastes, outperforming baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lower Bias, Higher Welfare: How Creator Competition Reshapes Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Recommendation Platforms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20289v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff in user representation learning is essential for improving recommendation quality in modern content platforms. While well studied in static settings, this tradeoff becomes significantly more complex when content creators strategically adapt to platform incentives. To analyze how such competition reshapes the tradeoff for maximizing user welfare, we introduce the Content Creator Competition with Bias-Variance Tradeoff framework, a tractable game-theoretic model that captures the platform's decision on regularization strength in user feature estimation. We derive and compare the platform's optimal policy under two key settings: a non-strategic baseline with fixed content and a strategic environment where creators compete in response to the platform's algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis in a stylized model shows that, compared to the non-strategic environment, content creator competition shifts the platform's optimal policy toward weaker regularization, thereby favoring lower bias in the bias-variance tradeoff. To validate and assess the robustness of these insights beyond the stylized setting, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The empirical results consistently support our theoretical conclusion: in strategic environments, reducing bias leads to higher user welfare. These findings offer practical implications for the design of real-world recommendation algorithms in the presence of content creator competition.</p></details> | KDD 2026 |
| **[Enhancing Sequential Recommendation with World Knowledge from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20177v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential Recommendation System~(SRS) has become pivotal in modern society, which predicts subsequent actions based on the user's historical behavior. However, traditional collaborative filtering-based sequential recommendation models often lead to suboptimal performance due to the limited information of their collaborative signals. With the rapid development of LLMs, an increasing number of works have incorporated LLMs' world knowledge into sequential recommendation. Although they achieve considerable gains, these approaches typically assume the correctness of LLM-generated results and remain susceptible to noise induced by LLM hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a flexible framework that integrates generation augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval, and holistic attention enhancement which employs multi-level attention to effectively employ LLM's world knowledge even with hallucinations and better capture users' dynamic interests. The retrieved similar users/items serve as auxiliary contextual information for the later holistic attention enhancement module, effectively mitigating the noisy guidance of supervision-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks and one industrial dataset reveal that GRASP consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when integrated with diverse backbones. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRASP-SRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Tri-View Diffusion Framework for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20122v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have recently gained significant interest for their exceptional potential in recommendation tasks. This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework has distinct superiority over baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, accepted by KDD2026 (First Cycle)</p></details> |

However, bundle-item (B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit' may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user preferences or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models may fluctuate or decline under item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to address the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR)asamodel-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by the BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances BR models' ability to generate high-quality item-level bundle embeddings. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increases training time about 4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version for AAAI'26</p></details> |

Yet, as their influence grows, traditional metrics, e.g., accuracy, clicks, and engagement, no longer capture what truly matters to humans. The workshop on Human-Centered Recommender Systems (HCRS) calls for a paradigm shift from optimizing engagement toward designing systems that truly understand, involve, and benefit people. It brings together researchers in recommender systems, human-computer interaction, AI safety, and social computing to explore how human values, e.g., trust, safety, fairness, transparency, and well-being, can be integrated into recommendation processes. Centered around three thematic axes-Human Understanding, Human Involvement, and Human Impact-HCRS features keynotes, panels, and papers covering topics from LLM-based interactive recommenders to societal welfare optimization.

The main bottleneck is the embedding layer, which is highly memory-intensive due to its sparse, irregular access patterns to embeddings. Recent near-memory processing (NMP) and processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have addressed these issues by exploiting parallelism within memory. However, as model sizes increase year by year and can exceed server capacity, inference on single-node servers becomes challenging, necessitating the integration of model compression. Various algorithms have been proposed for model size reduction, but they come at the cost of increased memory access and CPU-PIM communication. We present ProactivePIM, a PIM system tailored for weight-sharing algorithms, a family of compression methods that decompose an embedding table into compact subtables, such as QR-trick and TT-Rec. Our analysis shows that embedding layer execution with weight-sharing algorithms increases memory access and incurs CPU-PIM communication. We also find that these algorithms exhibit unique data locality characteristics, which we name intra-GnR locality. ProactivePIM accelerates weight-sharing algorithms by utilizing a heterogeneous HBM-DIMM memory architecture with integration of a two-level PIM system of base-die PIM (bd-PIM) and bank-group PIM (bg-PIM) inside the HBM. To gain further speedup, ProactivePIM prefetches embeddings with high intra-GnR locality into an SRAM cache within bg-PIM and eliminates the CPU-PIM communication through duplication of target subtables across bank groups. With additional optimization techniques, our design effectively accelerates weight-sharing algorithms, achieving 2.22x and 2.15x speedup in QR-trick and TT-Rec, respectively, compared to the baseline architecture.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[LLM-EDT: Large Language Model Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19931v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) has been proposed to enrich user-item interactions by incorporating information from various domains. Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT. To ease reproducibility, we have released the detailed code online at {https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-EDT-583F}.</p></details> |  |

The model posits that a large population of users, each with an opinion, consumes personalised content recommended by the RS. The RS can select from a range of content to recommend, based on users' past engagement, while users can engage with the content (like, watch), and in doing so, users' opinions evolve. This occurs repeatedly to capture the endless content available for user consumption on social media. We employ a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations to study how recommender systems influence users' opinions, and in turn how users' opinions shape the subsequent recommended content. Both the performance of the RS (e.g., how users engage with the content) and the polarisation and radicalisation of users' opinions are of interest. We find that different opinion distributions are more susceptible to becoming polarised than others, many content stances are ineffective in changing user opinions, and creating viral content is an effective measure in combating polarisation of opinions.

However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances leveraging external knowledge such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and large language models (LLMs), recommender systems still face challenges in practical environments. Static KGs are expensive to construct and quickly become outdated, while LLM-based methods depend on pre-filtered candidate lists due to limited context windows. To address these limitations, we propose ColdRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that dynamically constructs a knowledge graph from raw metadata, extracts entities and relations to construct an updatable structure, and introduces LLM-guided multi-hop reasoning at inference time to retrieve and rank candidates without relying on pre-filtered lists. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ColdRAG consistently outperforms strong seven baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, their lack of collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item (u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads achieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully deployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400 million users daily.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

| **[MGFRec: Towards Reinforced Reasoning Recommendation with Multiple Groundings and Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22888v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have inspired researchers to apply them to reasoning-based recommendation tasks, which require in-depth reasoning about user interests and the generation of recommended items. However, previous reasoning-based recommendation methods have typically performed inference within the language space alone, without incorporating the actual item space. This has led to over-interpreting user interests and deviating from real items. Towards this research gap, we propose performing multiple rounds of grounding during inference to help the LLM better understand the actual item space, which could ensure that its reasoning remains aligned with real items. Furthermore, we introduce a user agent that provides feedback during each grounding step, enabling the LLM to better recognize and adapt to user interests. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three Amazon review datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating multiple groundings and feedback. These findings underscore the critical importance of reasoning within the actual item space, rather than being confined to the language space, for recommendation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

However, existing systems are limited by insufficient functionality support and inefficient implementations for training GRMs in industrial scenarios. As such, we introduce MTGenRec as an efficient and scalable system for GRM training. Specifically, to handle real-time insertions/deletions of sparse embeddings, MTGenRec employs dynamic hash tables to replace static ones. To improve training efficiency, MTGenRec conducts dynamic sequence balancing to address the computation load imbalances among GPUs and adopts feature ID deduplication alongside automatic table merging to accelerate embedding lookup. Extensive experiments show that MTGenRec improves training throughput by $1.6\times -- 2.4\times$ while achieving good scalability when running over 100 GPUs. MTGenRec has been deployed for many applications in Meituan and is now handling hundreds of millions of requests on a daily basis. On the delivery platform, we observe a 1.22% growth in user order volume and a 1.31% enhancement in online PV_CTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[NEZHA: A Zero-sacrifice and Hyperspeed Decoding Architecture for Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18793v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Large Language Models with Adaptive Preference Optimization for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18740v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for sequential recommendation by enabling natural language reasoning over user behavior sequences. A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |

Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure.

Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[When Top-ranked Recommendations Fail: Modeling Multi-Granular Negative Feedback for Explainable and Robust Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18700v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video recommendation systems, relying mainly on ID-based embedding mapping and collaborative filtering, often fail to capture in-depth video content semantics. Moreover, most struggle to address biased user behaviors (e.g., accidental clicks, fast skips), leading to inaccurate interest modeling and frequent negative feedback in top recommendations with unclear causes. To tackle this issue, we collect real-world user video-watching sequences, annotate the reasons for users' dislikes, and construct a benchmark dataset for personalized explanations. We then introduce the Agentic Explainable Negative Feedback (ENF) framework, which integrates three core components: (1) the Profile Agent, extracting behavioral cues from users' historical data to derive psychological and personality profiles; (2) the Video Agent, performing comprehensive multimodal video analysis; and (3) the Reason Agent, synthesizing information from the other two agents to predict user engagement and generate explanations. Additionally, we propose the S-GRPO algorithm, enabling the model to progressively address complex tasks during reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in negative feedback prediction and reason explanation. Notably, it achieves an 8.6% improvement over GPT-4o in reason classification. Deployment on the business platform further validates its benefits: increasing average user watch time by 6.2%, reducing the fast-skip rate by 9.4%, and significantly enhancing user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Identifying the next most informative symptoms to assess, in order to distinguish between possible disorders, presents an additional challenge. This process requires comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic criteria and symptom overlap across disorders, making it difficult to navigate based on symptoms alone. This research aims to develop a recommender system for cognitive disorder diagnosis using binary matrix representations. The core algorithm utilizes a binary matrix of disorders and their symptom combinations. It filters through the rows and columns based on the patient's current symptoms to identify potential disorders and recommend the most informative next symptoms to examine. A prototype of the recommender system was implemented in Python. Using synthetic test and some real-life data, the system successfully identified plausible disorders from an initial symptom set and recommended further symptoms to refine the diagnosis. It also provided additional context on the symptom-disorder relationships. Although this is a prototype, the recommender system shows potential as a clinical support tool. A fully-developed application of this recommender system may assist mental health professionals in identifying relevant disorders more efficiently and guiding symptom-specific follow-up investigations to improve diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, it still lacks elements typical of physical stores, such as empathic support and personalised advice from a sales assistant. This study explores how an emotion-aware Conversational Agent (CA) can improve the online shopping experience by responding to user emotions in a more natural and human way. The project focuses on Gala, a virtual assistant developed for the Galeries Lafayette website, capable of recognising emotional states from voice messages and adapting its responses accordingly. User needs were first analysed through semi-structured interviews, which informed the design of Gala's UX and functionalities. Gala was implemented using the OpenAI API and the Galeries Lafayette API, adopting a Content-Based recommendation approach. Through Natural Language Processing, it interprets user requests and retrieves products aligned with specific attributes such as name, price, and brand, enabling fluid dialogue and tailored suggestions. Two user studies were conducted: a usability test and a comparative evaluation between a standard CA and Gala's emotion-aware version. The results highlight the potential of emotion-aware CAs to make online shopping faster, more engaging, and closer to an in-store guided experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences, where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens, and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Both ...</summary><p>Both authors contributed equally to this research.

| **[Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering: Orchestrating Users and Items for Agentic Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18413v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnWEIRDing LLM Entity Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18403v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have been widely been adopted by users for writing tasks such as sentence completions. While this can improve writing efficiency, prior research shows that LLM-generated suggestions may exhibit cultural biases which may be difficult for users to detect, especially in educational contexts for non-native English speakers. While such prior work has studied the biases in LLM moral value alignment, we aim to investigate cultural biases in LLM recommendations for real-world entities. To do so, we use the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) framework to evaluate recommendations by various LLMs across a dataset of fine-grained entities, and apply pluralistic prompt-based strategies to mitigate these biases. Our results indicate that while such prompting strategies do reduce such biases, this reduction is not consistent across different models, and recommendations for some types of entities are more biased than others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Matters: Enhancing Sequential Recommendations with Time-Guided Graph Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18347v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) is widely deployed in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, etc., revealing significant potential to enhance user experience. However, existing methods often overlook two critical factors: irregular user interests between interactions and highly uneven item distributions over time. The former factor implies that actual user preferences are not always continuous, and long-term historical interactions may not be relevant to current purchasing behavior. Therefore, relying only on these historical interactions for recommendations may result in a lack of user interest at the target time. The latter factor, characterized by peaks and valleys in interaction frequency, may result from seasonal trends, special events, or promotions. These externally driven distributions may not align with individual user interests, leading to inaccurate recommendations. To address these deficiencies, we propose TGODE to both enhance and capture the long-term historical interactions. Specifically, we first construct a user time graph and item evolution graph, which utilize user personalized preferences and global item distribution information, respectively. To tackle the temporal sparsity caused by irregular user interactions, we design a time-guided diffusion generator to automatically obtain an augmented time-aware user graph. Additionally, we devise a user interest truncation factor to efficiently identify sparse time intervals and achieve balanced preference inference. After that, the augmented user graph and item graph are fed into a generalized graph neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to align with the evolution of user preferences and item distributions. This allows two patterns of information evolution to be matched over time. Experimental results demonstrate that TGODE outperforms baseline methods across five datasets, with improvements ranging from 10% to 46%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Needle in a Haystack: Intent-driven Reusable Artifacts Recommendation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18343v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work. Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UFO effectively mitigates unfairness while improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 Tables, 5 images. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oglD54lvcB</p></details> |
| **[Capturing User Interests from Data Streams for Continual Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07466v3)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based sequential recommendation (SR) models excel at modeling long-range dependencies in user behavior via self-attention. However, updating them with continuously arriving behavior sequences incurs high computational costs or leads to catastrophic forgetting. Although continual learning, a standard approach for non-stationary data streams, has recently been applied to recommendation, existing methods gradually forget long-term user preferences and remain underexplored in SR. In this paper, we introduce Continual Sequential Transformer for Recommendation (CSTRec). CSTRec is designed to effectively adapt to current interests by leveraging well-preserved historical ones, thus capturing the trajectory of user interests over time. The core of CSTRec is Continual Sequential Attention (CSA), a linear attention tailored for continual SR, which enables CSTRec to partially retain historical knowledge without direct access to prior data. CSA has two key components: (1) Cauchy-Schwarz Normalization that stabilizes learning over time under uneven user interaction frequencies; (2) Collaborative Interest Enrichment that alleviates forgetting through shared, learnable interest pools. In addition, we introduce a new technique to facilitate the adaptation of new users by transferring historical knowledge from existing users with similar interests. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that CSTRec outperforms state-of-the-art models in both knowledge retention and acquisition.</p></details> | WSDM'26 |

Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> |  |

We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</p></details> |  |
| **[Fidelity-Aware Recommendation Explanations via Stochastic Path Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18047v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation.

Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Token-Controlled Re-ranking for Sequential Recommendation via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Generative Recommendation via Retrieval-based Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02939v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that tokenizes items into discrete tokens and learns to autoregressively generate the next tokens as predictions. While this token-generation paradigm is expected to surpass traditional transductive methods, potentially generating new items directly based on semantics, we empirically show that GR models predominantly generate items seen during training and struggle to recommend unseen items. In this paper, we propose SpecGR, a plug-and-play framework that enables GR models to recommend new items in an inductive setting. SpecGR uses a drafter model with inductive capability to propose candidate items, which may include both existing items and new items. The GR model then acts as a verifier, accepting or rejecting candidates while retaining its strong ranking capabilities. We further introduce the guided re-drafting technique to make the proposed candidates more aligned with the outputs of generative recommendation models, improving the verification efficiency. We consider two variants for drafting: (1) using an auxiliary drafter model for better flexibility, or (2) leveraging the GR model's own encoder for parameter-efficient self-drafting. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SpecGR exhibits both strong inductive recommendation ability and the best overall performance among the compared methods.

| **[Breaking the Curse of Knowledge: Towards Effective Multimodal Recommendation using Knowledge Soft Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07419v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical challenge in contemporary recommendation systems lies in effectively leveraging multimodal content to enhance recommendation personalization. Although various solutions have been proposed, most fail to account for discrepancies between knowledge extracted through isolated feature extraction and its application in recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature extraction does not incorporate task-specific prior knowledge, while downstream recommendation tasks typically use these features as auxiliary information. This misalignment often introduces biases in model fitting and degrades performance, a phenomenon we refer to as the curse of knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge soft integration framework designed to balance the utilization of multimodal features with the biases they may introduce. The framework, named Knowledge Soft Integration (KSI), comprises two key components: the Structure Efficient Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI) module. The SEI module employs a Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN) to model inter-modal correlations among items while introducing a regularization term to minimize redundancy in user and item representations. In parallel, the SSI module utilizes a self-supervised retrieval task to implicitly integrate multimodal semantic knowledge, thereby enhancing the semantic distinctiveness of item representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating KSI's effectiveness. Furthermore, these results underscore the ability of the SEI and SSI modules to reduce representation redundancy and mitigate the curse of knowledge in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[A neural recommender system leveraging transfer learning for property prediction of ionic liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10273v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework combined with a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure, and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. We find that the framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPR: Towards a Generative Pre-trained One-Model Paradigm for Large-Scale Advertising Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16943v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Task-Aligned Tool Recommendation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09613v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNL...</summary><p>IJCNLP-AACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with rich semantic knowledge, offer promising solutions to these challenges. However, deploying LLMs at scale is hindered by their significant computational demands and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable LLM-RecSys framework, LLMInit, designed to integrate pretrained LLM embeddings into CF models through selective initialization strategies. Specifically, we identify the embedding collapse issue observed when CF models scale and match the large embedding sizes in LLMs and avoid the problem by introducing efficient sampling methods, including, random, uniform, and variance-based selections. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMInit significantly improves recommendation performance while maintaining low computational costs, offering a practical and scalable solution for industrial applications. To facilitate industry adoption and promote future research, we provide open-source access to our implementation at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/LLMInit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |
| **[Music Recommendation with Large Language Models: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16478v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators. This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review with the ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |

Despite the impressive performance, the constant high volume of new user-item interactions makes it difficult to adapt to the evolution of user preference over time, especially for LLM-based recommender systems. The challenge arises from the large number of parameters in LLMs, which makes traditional evolution methods (i.e., Re-training or Fine-tuning) impractical. Specifically, Re-training with all interactions results in prohibitively high computational costs. On the other hand, fine-tuning with only new interactions leads to preference forgetting among inactive users, ultimately compromising overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose EvoRec, an efficient Locate-Forget-Update framework designed for LLM-based recommender systems to model the evolution of user preferences. EvoRec identifies a small set of parameters associated with preference changes and updates them precisely, thereby saving computational resources while maintaining strong recommendation performance. Notably, the modified parameters account for only 30\% of LoRA adapter parameters, with no additional parameters introduced. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EvoRec not only efficiently evolves LLMRec to adapt to the preferences of active users, but also preserves the interests of inactive users from being disturbed during evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

These keyphrases must be relevant to prevent irrelevant items from cluttering search systems and to maintain positive seller perception. It is vital that keyphrase suggestions align with seller, search and buyer judgments.

To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Intelligent Fashion Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07573v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of online fashion platforms has created an increasing demand for intelligent recommender systems capable of understanding both visual and textual cues. This paper proposes a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fashion recommendation that jointly addresses two key tasks: outfit compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an "outfit token" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset. For complementary item retrieval, a "target item token" representing the desired item description is used to retrieve compatible items, reaching an accuracy of 69.24% under the Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB) metric. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fashion recommendation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[SilverTorch: A Unified Model-based System to Democratize Large-Scale Recommendation on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14881v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) at scale is challenging. Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval. In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model. Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SilverTorch's solution is 13.35x more cost-efficient than CPU-based solution while improving accuracy via serving more complex models. SilverTorch serves over hundreds of models online across major products and recommends contents for billions of daily active users.</p></details> |  |

| **[Personalized Federated Recommendation With Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12959v2)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Recommendation (FedRec) has emerged as a key paradigm for building privacy-preserving recommender systems. However, existing FedRec models face a critical dilemma: memory-efficient single-knowledge models suffer from a suboptimal knowledge replacement practice that discards valuable personalization, while high-performance dual-knowledge models are often too memory-intensive for practical on-device deployment. We propose Federated Recommendation with Knowledge Guidance (FedRKG), a model-agnostic framework that resolves this dilemma. The core principle, Knowledge Guidance, avoids full replacement and instead fuses global knowledge into preserved local embeddings, attaining the personalization benefits of dual-knowledge within a single-knowledge memory footprint. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Guidance, a fine-grained mechanism that dynamically modulates the intensity of this guidance for each user-item interaction, overcoming the limitations of static fusion methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedRKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm.

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization for Local-Life Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14221v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors.

| **[WebRec: Enhancing LLM-based Recommendations with Attention-guided RAG from Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14182v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems play a vital role in alleviating information overload and enriching users' online experience. In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches require time-consuming fine-tuning, reference images for all subjects, or access to previously generated content. We introduce Contrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns), a framework that effectively synthesizes consistent subjects across multiple independent generations. The framework consists of a generative model and a mapping network that transforms input latent codes into pseudo-words associated with specific concept instances. Users can generate consistent subjects by reusing the same latent codes. To construct such associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the network to distinguish between different combinations of prompts and latent codes. Extensive evaluations on human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs comparably to existing methods while maintaining greater flexibility. We also demonstrate the potential for extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other object categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) supervised contrastive learning with Euclidean distance as the feature space metric is improved by replacing the standard loss function with Jenson-Shannon divergence (JSD); (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded $f$-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence choices in representation learning optimization.</p></details> |  |

Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05012v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This extended abstract introduces Self-Explaining Contrastive Evidence Re-Ranking (CER), a novel method that restructures retrieval around factual evidence by fine-tuning embeddings with contrastive learning and generating token-level attribution rationales for each retrieved passage. Hard negatives are automatically selected using a subjectivity-based criterion, forcing the model to pull factual rationales closer while pushing subjective or misleading explanations apart. As a result, the method creates an embedding space explicitly aligned with evidential reasoning. We evaluated our method on clinical trial reports, and initial experimental results show that CER improves retrieval accuracy, mitigates the potential for hallucinations in RAG systems, and provides transparent, evidence-based retrieval that enhances reliability, especially in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented as a poster at the Applied Social Media Lab during the 2025 Synthesizer & Open Showcase at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University</p></details> |
| **[Experience Replay with Random Reshuffling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02269v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experience replay is a key component in reinforcement learning for stabilizing learning and improving sample efficiency. Its typical implementation samples transitions with replacement from a replay buffer. In contrast, in supervised learning with a fixed dataset, it is a common practice to shuffle the dataset every epoch and consume data sequentially, which is called random reshuffling (RR). RR enjoys theoretically better convergence properties and has been shown to outperform with-replacement sampling empirically. To leverage the benefits of RR in reinforcement learning, we propose sampling methods that extend RR to experience replay, both in uniform and prioritized settings, and analyze their properties via theoretical analysis and simulations. We evaluate our sampling methods on Atari benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in deep reinforcement learning. Code is available at https://github.com/pfnet-research/errr.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Causality for Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04980v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis develops methods for causal inference and causal representation learning (CRL) in high-dimensional, time-varying data. The first contribution introduces the Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), a model for estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) by capturing unobserved heterogeneity in treatment response driven by latent risk factors that affect only outcomes. CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables. The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference. The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions. Scalable Jacobian-based regularization techniques are also developed.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis manuscript</p></details> |

| **[Balanced Few-Shot Episodic Learning for Accurate Retinal Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04967v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Environment-Aware Channel Inference via Cross-Modal Flow: From Multimodal Sensing to Wireless Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04966v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, 40 references, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | ACM SIGKDD 2025 |
| **[Language Models as Semantic Teachers: Post-Training Alignment for Medical Audio Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04847v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained audio models excel at detecting acoustic patterns in auscultation sounds but often fail to grasp their clinical significance, limiting their use and performance in diagnostic tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a "semantic teacher." To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16016v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL) often degrade policy performance. Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: 1) the Reach-Always-Avoid (RAA) problem -- of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds -- and 2) the Reach-Reach (RR) problem -- of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context via decomposition. Specifically, we prove that the RAA and RR problems may be rewritten as compositions of previously studied HJ-RL problems. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DOHJ-PPO), and demonstrate that it produces distinct behaviors from previous approaches, outcompeting a number of baselines in success, safety and speed across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent in Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD)-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by discriminating between real data and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-generated contrastive samples using the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training strategy that addresses normalization-related instabilities and enables leveraging pretrained robust classifiers, generalizing effectively across diverse architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach: (1) is the first EBM-based hybrid to scale to high-resolution datasets with high training stability, simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performance on ImageNet 256$\times$256; (2) uniquely combines generative quality with adversarial robustness, enabling critical applications like robust counterfactual explanations; and (3) functions as a competitive standalone generative model, matching the generative quality of autoregressive methods (VAR-d16) and surpassing diffusion models while offering unique versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: I...</summary><p>V2: ImageNet 256x256 with ConvNeXt-Large (FID 3.29), formal theoretical analysis, L_inf training, computational analysis, expanded related work/baselines.

| **[TTRV: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06783v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageNot: A contrast with ImageNet preserves model rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02112v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ImageNot, a dataset constructed explicitly to be drastically different than ImageNet while matching its scale. ImageNot is designed to test the external validity of deep learning progress on ImageNet. We show that key model architectures developed for ImageNet over the years rank identically to how they rank on ImageNet when trained from scratch and evaluated on ImageNot. Moreover, the relative improvements of each model over earlier models strongly correlate in both datasets. Our work demonstrates a surprising degree of external validity in the relative performance of image classification models when trained and evaluated on an entirely different dataset. This stands in contrast with absolute accuracy numbers that typically drop sharply even under small changes to a dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherPrompt: Multi-modality Representation Learning for All-Weather Drone Visual Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09560v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather, and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog and snow conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Decoding of Overt Speech from ECoG Using Vision Transformers and Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04618v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the "missing modality" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues. Our MLL strategy combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, focal, center, and supervised contrastive loss to optimize learning, address class imbalance, and improve feature separability. We evaluate our method on four widely used SER datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, RAVDESS, and SAVEE. The results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026.

Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models.

In particular, the capability of our proposed GDN being able to predict geodesics is important for quantifying and comparing deformable shape presented in images. The geodesic deformations, also known as optimal transformations that align pairwise images, are often parameterized by a time sequence of smooth vector fields governed by nonlinear differential equations. A bountiful literature has been focusing on learning the initial conditions (e.g., initial velocity fields) based on registration networks. However, the definition of geodesics central to deformation-based shape analysis is blind to the networks. To address this problem, we carefully develop an efficient neural operator to treat the geodesics as unknown mapping functions learned from the latent deformation spaces. A composition of integral operators and smooth activation functions is then formulated to effectively approximate such mappings. In contrast to previous works, our GDN jointly optimizes a newly defined geodesic loss, which adds additional benefits to promote the network regularizability and generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDN on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p></details> |  |

While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main, Code is available https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/SYNTHIA</p></details> |

However, deeper semantic understanding, contextual coherence, and more subtle reasoning are still difficult to obtain. The paper discusses state-of-the-art methodologies that advance LLMs with more advanced NLU techniques, such as semantic parsing, knowledge integration, and contextual reinforcement learning. We analyze the use of structured knowledge graphs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies that match models with human-level understanding. Furthermore, we address the incorporation of transformer-based architectures, contrastive learning, and hybrid symbolic-neural methods that address problems like hallucinations, ambiguity, and inconsistency in the factual perspectives involved in performing complex NLP tasks, such as question-answering text summarization and dialogue generation. Our findings show the importance of semantic precision for enhancing AI-driven language systems and suggest future research directions to bridge the gap between statistical language models and true natural language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Driving is a Game: Combining Planning and Prediction with Bayesian Iterative Best Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03936v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving planning systems perform nearly perfectly in routine scenarios using lightweight, rule-based methods but still struggle in dense urban traffic, where lane changes and merges require anticipating and influencing other agents. Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Attack Discovery for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03882v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DeLiVER datasets.

| **[Origin-Conditional Trajectory Encoding: Measuring Urban Configurational Asymmetries through Neural Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03755v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban analytics increasingly relies on AI-driven trajectory analysis, yet current approaches suffer from methodological fragmentation: trajectory learning captures movement patterns but ignores spatial context, while spatial embedding methods encode street networks but miss temporal dynamics. Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Visual Prompting for Lightweight Small-Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03663v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images.</p></details> |  |
| **[AaPE: Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding for Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03637v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based audio SSL (self-supervised learning) models often treat spectrograms as images, applying convolutional patchification with heavy temporal downsampling. This lowers the effective Nyquist frequency and introduces aliasing, while naïve low-pass filtering removes task-relevant high-frequency cues. In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens. AaPE integrates seamlessly into the masked teacher-student self-supervised learning. In addition, we combine a multi-mask strategy with a contrastive objective to enforce consistency across diverse mask patterns, stabilizing training. Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a subset of tasks and competitive results across the remainder. Complementary linear probing evaluation mirrors this pattern, yielding clear gains on several benchmarks and strong performance elsewhere. The collective analysis of these results indicates that AaPE serves to mitigate the effects of aliasing without discarding of informative high-frequency content.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |

Current control methods' decoupled control of altitude and position leads to significant vibration, and limits interaction consideration and adaptability. In this study, we propose a novel coupled transition control methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) driven controller. Besides, contrasting to the conventional phase-transition approach, the ST3M method demonstrates a new perspective by treating cruise mode as a special case of hover. We validate the feasibility of applying our method in simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating efficient controller development and migration while accurately controlling UAV position and attitude, exhibiting outstanding trajectory tracking and reduced vibrations during the transition process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Fairness Aware Multi Task Federated Learning for VR Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02513v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at IEEE Globecom Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[AutoEnv: Automated Environments for Measuring Cross-Environment Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19304v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

Inspired by Test-Time Training (TTT) in large language models, we propose scaling TTT for CLMs to enhance chemical space exploration. We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency. These findings provide a scalable framework for generative molecular design, offering insights into optimizing AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches remain heavily English-centric, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. In this work, we present M3DR (Multilingual Multimodal Document Retrieval), a framework designed to bridge this gap across languages, enabling applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms. Our models, NetraEmbed and ColNetraEmbed achieve state-of-the-art performance with ~150% relative improvements on cross-lingual retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

| **[Rethinking Security in Semantic Communication: Latent Manipulation as a New Threat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03361v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

The general goal is to learn a fast approximator of solutions to constrained optimization problems, as a function of their defining parameters. Prior L2O methods focus almost entirely on single-level programs, in contrast to the bilevel programs, whose constraints are themselves expressed in terms of optimization subproblems. Bilevel programs have numerous important use cases but are notoriously difficult to solve, particularly under stringent time demands. This paper proposes a framework for learning to solve a broad class of challenging bilevel optimization problems, by leveraging modern techniques for differentiation through optimization problems. The framework is illustrated on an array of synthetic bilevel programs, as well as challenging control system co-design problems, showing how neural networks can be trained as efficient approximators of parametric bilevel optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal LLM Routing: End-to-End Regret Minimization from Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16037v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query, balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy, where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models, which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different embedding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASPEN: An Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network for Ginzburg-Landau Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03290v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Assumption-Lean Differential Variance Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03254v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is frequently estimated to refute the homogeneous treatment effect assumption. Under this assumption, all units making up the population under study experience identical benefit from a given treatment. Uncovering heterogeneous treatment effects through inference about the CATE, however, requires that covariates truly modifying the treatment effect be reliably collected at baseline. CATE-based techniques will necessarily fail to detect violations when effect modifiers are omitted from the data due to, for example, resource constraints. Severe measurement error has a similar impact. To address these limitations, we prove that the homogeneous treatment effect assumption can be gauged through inference about contrasts of the potential outcomes' variances. We derive causal machine learning estimators of these contrasts and study their asymptotic properties. We establish that these estimators are doubly robust and asymptotically linear under mild conditions, permitting formal hypothesis testing about the homogeneous treatment effect assumption even when effect modifiers are missing or mismeasured. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these estimators' asymptotic guarantees are approximately achieved in experimental and observational data alike. These inference procedures are then used to detect heterogeneous treatment effects in the re-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating targeted temperature management in cardiac arrest patients.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a novel skew-symmetric neural architecture as closure model that enforces stability while preserving key physical conservation laws. Our approach leverages a discretization that ensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with a face-averaging filter to maintain mass conservation in coarse-grained velocity fields. We compare our model against several conventional data-driven closures (including unconstrained convolutional neural networks), and the physics-based Smagorinsky model. Performance is evaluated on decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow for multiple coarse-graining factors. In these test cases we observe that unconstrained machine learning models suffer from numerical instabilities. In contrast, our skew-symmetric model remains stable across all tests, though at the cost of increased dissipation. Despite this trade-off, we demonstrate that our model still outperforms the Smagorinsky model in unseen scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of structure-preserving machine learning closures for reliable long-time LES.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 11 figures, source code can be found at https://github.com/tobyvg/LES_ML.jl</p></details> |

This review examines the development and application of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) in remote sensing, focusing on their ability to interpret and describe satellite imagery using natural language. We cover the technical underpinnings of MLLMs, including dual-encoder architectures, Transformer models, self-supervised and contrastive learning, and cross-modal integration. The unique challenges of remote sensing data--varying spatial resolutions, spectral richness, and temporal changes--are analyzed for their impact on MLLM performance. Key applications such as scene description, object detection, change detection, text-to-image retrieval, image-to-text generation, and visual question answering are discussed to demonstrate their relevance in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. We review significant datasets and resources supporting the training and evaluation of these models. Challenges related to computational demands, scalability, data quality, and domain adaptation are highlighted. We conclude by proposing future research directions and technological advancements to further enhance MLLM utility in remote sensing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings highlight the potential of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling to improve non-invasive prostate cancer characterization and reduce unnecessary biopsies.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard "think-then-answer" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Deep Learning for Variant Detection in Wastewater Genomic Sequencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03158v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wastewater-based genomic surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for population-level viral monitoring, offering comprehensive insights into circulating viral variants across entire communities. However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19238v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $ε$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(ε^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($γ$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $γ$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Theory of Contrastive Learning for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02831v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is among the most popular and powerful approaches for self-supervised representation learning, where the goal is to map semantically similar samples close together while separating dissimilar ones in the latent space. Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily rely on a global VL alignment directly adapted from 2D scenarios. The entire 3D image is transformed into one global embedding, resulting in a loss of sparse but critical semantics essential for accurately aligning with the corresponding diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose CT-GLIP, a 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretrained model that constructs fine-grained CT-report pairs to enhance \textit{grounded} cross-modal contrastive learning, effectively aligning grounded visual features with precise textual descriptions. Leveraging the grounded cross-modal alignment, CT-GLIP improves performance across diverse downstream tasks and can even identify organs and abnormalities in a zero-shot manner using natural language. CT-GLIP is trained on a multimodal CT dataset comprising 44,011 organ-level CT-report pairs from 17,702 patients, covering 104 organs. Evaluation is conducted on four downstream tasks: zero-shot organ recognition (OR), zero-shot abnormality detection (AD), tumor detection (TD), and tumor segmentation (TS). Empirical results show that it outperforms its counterparts with global VL alignment. Compared to vanilla CLIP, CT-GLIP achieves average performance improvements of 15.1% of F1 score, 1.9% of AUC, and 3.2% of DSC for zero-shot AD, TD, and TS tasks, respectively. This study highlights the significance of grounded VL alignment in enabling 3D medical VL foundation models to understand sparse representations within CT scans.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyMoE: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Enhancing Geospatial Interpretation with Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02517v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiCaP: Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling for Semi-Supervised Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20225v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data in multi-label learning (MLL) by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-26 |

Drawing inspiration from biological systems where roles naturally emerge to enable coordination, role-based MARL methods have been proposed to enhance cooperation learning for complex tasks. However, existing methods exclusively derive roles from an agent's past experience during training, neglecting their influence on its future trajectories. This paper introduces a key insight: an agent's role should shape its future behavior to enable effective coordination. Hence, we propose Role Discovery and Diversity through Dynamics Models (R3DM), a novel role-based MARL framework that learns emergent roles by maximizing the mutual information between agents' roles, observed trajectories, and expected future behaviors. R3DM optimizes the proposed objective through contrastive learning on past trajectories to first derive intermediate roles that shape intrinsic rewards to promote diversity in future behaviors across different roles through a learned dynamics model. Benchmarking on SMAC and SMACv2 environments demonstrates that R3DM outperforms state-of-the-art MARL approaches, improving multi-agent coordination to increase win rates by up to 20%.

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .</p></details> | WACV 2026 |
| **[From Atomic to Composite: Reinforcement Learning Enables Generalization in Complementary Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01970v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

| **[From Detection to Association: Learning Discriminative Object Embeddings for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02392v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.</p></details> |  |

Recent neural network-based solutions to the CDMN task adopt a kind of representation fusion and global division paradigm: Each node is first learned a kind of layer-wise representations which are then fused for global community division. However, even with contrastive or attentive fusion mechanisms, the fused global representations often lack the discriminative power to capture structural nuances unique to each layer. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the CDMN task: Layered Division and Global Allocation (LDGA). The core idea is to first perform layer-wise group division, based on which global community allocation is next performed. Concretely, LDGA employs a multi-head Transformer as the backbone representation encoder, where each head is for encoding node structural characteristics in each network layer. We integrate the Transformer with a community-latent encoder to capture community prototypes in each layer. A shared scorer performs layered division by generating layer-wise soft assignments, while global allocation assigns each node the community label with highest confidence across all layers to form the final consensus partition. We design a loss function that couples differentiable multilayer modularity with a cluster balance regularizer to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks demonstrate that our LDGA outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of higher detected community modularities. Our code with parameter settings and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LDGA-552B/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02323v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited. Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present **Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD)**, a novel algorithm that grounds skill discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere, clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a simulated SMPL humanoid with $359$-D observations and $69$-D actions, RGSD successfully imitates skills such as walking, running, punching, and sidestepping, while also discover variations of these behaviors. In downstream locomotion tasks, RGSD leverages the discovered skills to faithfully satisfy user-specified style commands and outperforms imitation-learning baselines, which often fail to maintain the commanded style. Overall, our results suggest that lightweight reference-grounding offers a practical path to discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.</p></details> |  |

While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

| **[Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Cross-View Topology-Aware Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02130v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGDiff: Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model for Image Collaborative SegCaptioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01975v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI-2025 |
| **[Adaptive Plane Reformatting for 4D Flow MRI using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00727v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective: Plane reformatting for four-dimensional phase contrast MRI (4D flow MRI) is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, which limits fast cardiovascular flow assessment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) trains agents to iteratively adjust plane position and orientation, enabling accurate plane reformatting without the need for detailed landmarks, making it suitable for images with limited contrast and resolution such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods assume that test volumes share the same spatial alignment as the training data, limiting generalization across scanners and institutions. To address this limitation, we introduce AdaPR (Adaptive Plane Reformatting), a DRL framework that uses a local coordinate system to navigate volumes with arbitrary positions and orientations. Methods: We implemented AdaPR using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm and validated it on 88 4D flow MRI datasets acquired from multiple vendors, including patients with congenital heart disease. Results: AdaPR achieved a mean angular error of 6.32 +/- 4.15 degrees and a distance error of 3.40 +/- 2.75 mm, outperforming global-coordinate DRL methods and alternative non-DRL methods. AdaPR maintained consistent accuracy under different volume orientations and positions. Flow measurements from AdaPR planes showed no significant differences compared to two manual observers, with excellent correlation (R^2 = 0.972 and R^2 = 0.968), comparable to inter-observer agreement (R^2 = 0.969). Conclusion: AdaPR provides robust, orientation-independent plane reformatting for 4D flow MRI, achieving flow quantification comparable to expert observers. Its adaptability across datasets and scanners makes it a promising candidate for medical imaging applications beyond 4D flow MRI.</p></details> |  |

Our model tuning strategy for med-gte-hybrid combines contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder. To evaluate the performance of med-gte-hybrid, we investigate several clinical prediction tasks in large patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient prognosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prediction, and patient mortality prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the med-gte-hybrid model improves patient stratification, clustering, and text retrieval, thus outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While some of our evaluations focus on CKD, our hybrid tuning of sentence transformers could be transferred to other medical domains and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and personalised treatment pathways in various healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The problem is hampered by its combinatorially large yet sparse solution space thus making learning to assemble a challenging task for current machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task by leveraging the assembly instructions provided in diagrammatic manuals that typically accompany the furniture parts. Our key insight is to use the cues in these diagrams to split the problem into discrete and continuous phases. Specifically, we present Manual-PA, a transformer-based instruction Manual-guided 3D Part Assembly framework that learns to semantically align 3D parts with their illustrations in the manuals using a contrastive learning backbone towards predicting the assembly order and infers the 6D pose of each part via relating it to the final furniture depicted in the manual. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the benchmark PartNet dataset. Our results show that using the diagrams and the order of the parts lead to significant improvements in assembly performance against the state of the art. Further, Manual-PA demonstrates strong generalization to real-world IKEA furniture assembly on the IKEA-Manual dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV'25 |
| **[Skewed Neuronal Heterogeneity Enhances Efficiency On Various Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05126v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous property of many biological systems and has profound implications for computation. While it is conceivable to optimize neuronal and synaptic heterogeneity for a specific task, such top-down optimization is biologically implausible, prone to catastrophic forgetting, and both data- and energy-intensive. In contrast, biological organisms, with remarkable capacity to perform numerous tasks with minimal metabolic cost, exhibit a heterogeneity that is inherent, stable during adulthood, and task-unspecific. Inspired by this intrinsic form of heterogeneity, we investigate the utility of variations in neuronal time constants for solving hundreds of distinct temporal tasks of varying complexity. Our results show that intrinsic heterogeneity significantly enhances performance and robustness in an implementation-independent manner, indicating its usefulness for both (rate-based) machine learning and (spike-coded) neuromorphic applications. Importantly, only skewed heterogeneity profiles-reminiscent of those found in biology-produce such performance gains. We further demonstrate that this computational advantage eliminates the need for large networks, allowing comparable performance with substantially lower operational, metabolic, and energetic costs, respectively in silico, in vivo, and on neuromorphic hardware. Finally, we discuss the implications of intrinsic (rather than task-induced) heterogeneity for the design of efficient artificial systems, particularly novel neuromorphic devices that exhibit similar device-to-device variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[IGen: Scalable Data Generation for Robot Learning from Open-World Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01773v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Robust Rigid and Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration Using Learnable Edge Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01771v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |
| **[Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation from Six Wearable Sensor Modalities in Multi-Motion-State Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01653v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Method to Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13632v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, "black box" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised One-Step Diffusion Refinement for Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07417v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multispectral images (MSIs) using a single coded two-dimensional (2-D) measurement, but reconstructing high-fidelity MSIs from these compressed inputs remains a fundamentally ill-posed challenge. While diffusion-based reconstruction methods have recently raised the bar for quality, they face critical limitations: a lack of large-scale MSI training data, adverse domain shifts from RGB-pretrained models, and inference inefficiencies due to multi-step sampling. These drawbacks restrict their practicality in real-world applications. In contrast to existing methods, which either follow costly iterative refinement or adapt subspace-based embeddings for diffusion models (e.g. DiffSCI, PSR-SCI), we introduce a fundamentally different paradigm: a self-supervised One-Step Diffusion (OSD) framework specifically designed for SCI. The key novelty lies in using a single-step diffusion refiner to correct an initial reconstruction, eliminating iterative denoising entirely while preserving generative quality. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised equivariant learning strategy to train both the predictor and refiner directly from raw 2-D measurements, enabling generalization to unseen domains without the need for ground-truth MSI. To further address the challenge of limited MSI data, we design a band-selection-driven distillation strategy that transfers core generative priors from large-scale RGB datasets, effectively bridging the domain gap. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach sets a new benchmark, yielding PSNR gains of 3.44 dB, 1.61 dB, and 0.28 dB on the Harvard, NTIRE, and ICVL datasets, respectively, while reducing reconstruction time by 97.5%. This remarkable improvement in efficiency and adaptability makes our method a significant advancement in SCI reconstruction, combining both accuracy and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, manual grading is subjective and inefficient, while existing deep learning solutions often lack clinical explainability or suffer from accumulated errors in segmentation area estimation. To address these issues, this study proposes AttnRegDeepLab (Attention-Guided Regression DeepLab), a framework characterized by dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL). A vanilla DeepLabV3+ decoder is modified by integrating Attention Gates into its skip connections, explicitly suppressing cytoplasmic noise to preserve contour details. Furthermore, a Multi-Scale Regression Head is introduced with a Feature Injection mechanism to propagate global grading priors into the segmentation task, rectifying systematic quantification errors. A 2-stage decoupled training strategy is proposed to address the gradient conflict in MTL. Also, a range-based loss is designed to leverage weakly labeled data. Our method achieves robust grading precision while maintaining excellent segmentation accuracy (Dice coefficient =0.729), in contrast to the end-to-end counterpart that might minimize grading error at the expense of contour integrity. This work provides a clinically interpretable solution that balances visual fidelity and quantitative precision.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios.

In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  |

In contrast with the state-of-the-art method of CASA, where sequences of 3D skeleton coordinates are taken directly as input, our key idea is to use sequences of 2D skeleton heatmaps as input. Unlike CASA which performs self-attention in the temporal domain only, we feed 2D skeleton heatmaps to a video transformer which performs self-attention both in the spatial and temporal domains for extracting effective spatiotemporal and contextual features. In addition, we introduce simple heatmap augmentation techniques based on 2D skeletons for self-supervised learning. Despite the lack of 3D information, our approach achieves not only higher accuracy but also better robustness against missing and noisy keypoints than CASA. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on three public datasets, i.e., Penn Action, IKEA ASM, and H2O, demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in different fine-grained human activity understanding tasks. Finally, fusing 2D skeleton heatmaps with RGB videos yields the state-of-the-art on all metrics and datasets. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to utilize 2D skeleton heatmap inputs and the first to explore multi-modality fusion for temporal video alignment.

Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

This stands in contrast to samplable PAC learning (Blum, Furst, Kearns, and Lipton 1993), where learners only have to succeed under samplable distributions. We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners. We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from. Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded.</p></details> | ITCS 2026 |

Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.</p></details> |  |

These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v4)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A County-Level Similarity Network of Electric Vehicle Adoption: Integrating Predictive Modeling and Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14999v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is essential for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), which account for nearly half of transportation-related emissions in the United States. Yet regional EV adoption varies widely, and prior studies often overlook county-level heterogeneity by relying on broad state-level analyses or limited city samples. Such approaches risk masking local patterns and may lead to inaccurate or non-transferable policy recommendations. This study introduces a graph-theoretic framework that complements predictive modeling to better capture how county-level characteristics relate to EV adoption. Feature importances from multiple predictive models are averaged and used as weights within a weighted Gower similarity metric to construct a county similarity network. A mutual k-nearest-neighbors procedure and modularity-based community detection identify 27 clusters of counties with similar weighted feature profiles. EV adoption rates are then analyzed across clusters, and standardized effect sizes (Cohens d) highlight the most distinguishing features for each cluster. Findings reveal consistent global trends, such as declining median income, educational attainment, and charging-station availability across lower adoption tiers; while also uncovering important local variations that general trend or prediction analyses fail to capture. In particular, some low-adoption groups are rural but not economically disadvantaged, whereas others are urbanized yet experience high poverty rates, demonstrating that different mechanisms can lead to the same adoption outcome. By exposing both global structural patterns and localized deviations, this framework provides policymakers with actionable, cluster-specific insights for designing more effective and context-sensitive EV adoption strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Conversational Recommender Systems with Tree-Structured Knowledge and Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12579v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05636v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 185 pages |
| **[Attention Enhanced Entity Recommendation for Intelligent Monitoring in Cloud Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20640v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes, and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it 4.5 out of 5.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19246v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERO: Heterogeneous Continual Graph Learning via Meta-Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17458v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks have seen rapid progress in web applications such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, driven by the inherent heterogeneity of web data. However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |
| **[MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12054v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility, persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings, heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories, and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-Aware Generative Next POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12350v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2) previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation). Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG) format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure, thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model introduces a fusion-free deep mutual learning strategy that aligns modality-specific representations from lyrics, audio, and visual data while maintaining robustness against missing modalities. A heterogeneous graph structure is constructed to capture both user-song interactions and user-user social relationships, enabling the integration of individual preferences with social influence. Furthermore, emotion-aware embeddings derived from acoustic and textual signals contribute to emotionally aligned recommendations. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various performance metrics. Ablation studies further validate the critical impact of each model component, confirming the effectiveness of the framework in delivering accurate and socially contextualized music recommendations.</p></details> |  |

We present RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\% (Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late fusion and LLM-only variants.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models (FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |
| **[Bayesian and Multi-Objective Decision Support for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Incident Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00770v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research proposes a real-time, adaptive decision-support framework for mitigating cyber incidents in cyber-physical systems, developed in response to an increasing reliance on these systems within critical infrastructure and evolving adversarial tactics. Existing decision-support systems often fall short in accounting for multi-agent, multi-path attacks and trade-offs between safety and operational continuity. To address this, our framework integrates hierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, constructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability data. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance computational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a hybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit Prediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via Bayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by incomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations are generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood, impact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and resource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied to prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework was evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios, demonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under real-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational contexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse threat environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the observation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse queries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this query diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage grows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |
| **[Where to Go Next Day: Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Model for Mid-term Human Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06561v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting individual mobility patterns is crucial across various applications. While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multi-scale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. Additionally, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multi-scale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP's advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in MAE for cumulative new cases.</p></details> |  |

Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations, and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket" user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000 users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector-Centric Machine Learning Systems: A Cross-Stack Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08469v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First, modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the hardware landscape. Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms, systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG serving efficiency across the computing stack.

These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters. The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data (including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13 distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and 127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic, association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference, and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets, including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of 89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases, along with feedback-based learning from physician input.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Personalization: Unifying Recommender Systems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01514v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Generative AI for Recommender Systems and Personalization at the ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (GenAIRecP@KDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Learning-Enhanced MPC for Safe Crowd Navigation with Heterogeneous Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09859v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for robot navigation in dynamic environments with heterogeneous constraints. Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Artifact ConnecTor (PACT): Embedding Enterprise Artifacts for Compliance AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21142v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe. We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender system.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIF-MR: Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09998v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) and multimodal item information, which respectively capture relational and attribute features, play a crucial role in improving recommender system accuracy. Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Network Enhanced Sequential Recommendation Method for Cross-Platform Ad Campaign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08959v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context) shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further improved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Graph Integration for Cross-Domain Recommendation via Heterogeneous Graph Coordinators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11719v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, users typically interact with diverse items across multiple domains (e.g., e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social networks), generating intricate heterogeneous interaction graphs. Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph co\textbf{O}rdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

Modern recommendation systems leverage Graph Neural Network (GNN) due to their ability to produce high-quality recommendations in terms of both relevance and diversity. Therefore, the explainability of GNN is especially important for Link Prediction (LP) tasks since recommending relevant items can be viewed as predicting links between users and items. GNN explainability has been a well-studied field, but existing methods primarily focus on node or graph-level tasks, leaving a gap in LP explanation techniques. This work introduces Z-REx, a GNN explanation framework designed explicitly for heterogeneous link prediction tasks. Z-REx utilizes structural and attribute perturbation to identify critical substructures and important features while reducing the search space by leveraging domain-specific knowledge. In our experimentation, we show the efficacy of Z-REx in generating contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations for ZiGNN, a GNN-based recommendation engine, using a real-world real-estate dataset from Zillow Group, Inc. We compare against State-of-The-Art (SOTA) GNN explainers to show Z-REx outperforms them by 61% in the Fidelity metric by producing superior human-interpretable explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published in KDD Workshop in Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI@KDD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Recommendation Unlearning for Legal, Licensing, and Modality Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15328v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User data spread across multiple modalities has popularized multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS). They recommend diverse content such as products, social media posts, TikTok reels, etc., based on a user-item interaction graph. With rising data privacy demands, recent methods propose unlearning private user data from uni-modal recommender systems (RS). However, methods for unlearning item data related to outdated user preferences, revoked licenses, and legally requested removals are still largely unexplored. Previous RS unlearning methods are unsuitable for MMRS due to the incompatibility of their matrix-based representation with the multi-modal user-item interaction graph. Moreover, their data partitioning step degrades performance on each shard due to poor data heterogeneity and requires costly performance aggregation across shards. This paper introduces MMRecUn, the first approach known to us for unlearning in MMRS and unlearning item data. Given a trained RS model, MMRecUn employs a novel Reverse Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective to enable the model to forget marked data. The reverse BPR attenuates the impact of user-item interactions within the forget set, while the forward BPR reinforces the significance of user-item interactions within the retain set. Our experiments demonstrate that MMRecUn outperforms baseline methods across various unlearning requests when evaluated on benchmark MMRS datasets. MMRecUn achieves recall performance improvements of up to 49.85% compared to baseline methods and is up to 1.3x faster than the Gold model, which is trained on retain set from scratch. MMRecUn offers significant advantages, including superiority in removing target interactions, preserving retained interactions, and zero overhead costs compared to previous methods.

Modern research solutions facilitate music discovery according to user tastes. However, defining similarity among artists remains challenging due to its inherently subjective nature, which can impact recommendation accuracy. This paper introduces GATSY, a novel recommendation system built upon graph attention networks and driven by a clusterized embedding of artists. The proposed framework leverages the graph topology of the input data to achieve outstanding performance results without relying heavily on hand-crafted features. This flexibility allows us to include fictitious artists within a music dataset, facilitating connections between previously unlinked artists and enabling diverse recommendations from various and heterogeneous sources. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to state-of-the-art solutions while maintaining flexibility.

Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) - a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data, relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii) the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models that can transform the processing of relational data.</p></details> |  |

Designing such systems involves integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics, and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning, which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system, our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact applications.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the creation of more than a thousand knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender systems for the Linked Open Data cloud.

Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers' expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes of developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems.

Traditional methods like collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users' latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings. Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Dynamically adding collaborative signals from neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied, the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware) embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning (such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances recommendations.</p></details> |  |

However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven advancements in time-series causal discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted at KDD 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |
| **[Gated Multimodal Graph Learning for Personalized Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00107v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational overhead. In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear transformations. We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain. Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware, and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Masked Contrastive Learning for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24172v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in exploiting auxiliary information for recommendation tasks. However, graphs constructed using meta-paths in HGNNs are usually too dense and contain a large number of noise edges. The propagation mechanism of HGNNs propagates even small amounts of noise in a graph to distant neighboring nodes, thereby affecting numerous node embeddings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel model, named Masked Contrastive Learning (MCL), to enhance recommendation robustness to noise. MCL employs a random masking strategy to augment the graph via meta-paths, reducing node sensitivity to specific neighbors and bolstering embedding robustness. Furthermore, MCL employs contrastive cross-view on a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) from two perspectives: one-hop neighbors and meta-path neighbors. This approach acquires embeddings capturing both local and high-order structures simultaneously for recommendation. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm the superiority of our approach over existing recommendation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional Graph Neural Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1703.00552, arXiv:1403.2844 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[GGBond: Growing Graph-Based AI-Agent Society for Socially-Aware Recommender Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21154v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms, including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily. During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization, MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled, observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeteroBA: A Structure-Manipulating Backdoor Attack on Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21140v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently drawn increasing attention for modeling complex multi-relational data in domains such as recommendation, finance, and social networks. While existing research has been largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[The Limits of Graph Samplers for Training Inductive Recommender Systems: Extended results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14241v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive Recommender Systems are capable of recommending for new users and with new items thus avoiding the need to retrain after new data reaches the system. However, these methods are still trained on all the data available, requiring multiple days to train a single model, without counting hyperparameter tuning. In this work we focus on graph-based recommender systems, i.e., systems that model the data as a heterogeneous network. In other applications, graph sampling allows to study a subgraph and generalize the findings to the original graph. Thus, we investigate the applicability of sampling techniques for this task. We test on three real world datasets, with three state-of-the-art inductive methods, and using six different sampling methods. We find that its possible to maintain performance using only 50% of the training data with up to 86% percent decrease in training time; however, using less training data leads to far worse performance. Further, we find that when it comes to data for recommendations, graph sampling should also account for the temporal dimension. Therefore, we find that if higher data reduction is needed, new graph based sampling techniques should be studied and new inductive methods should be designed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Embedding at Scale: Optimizing CPU-GPU-SSD Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09258v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph embeddings provide continuous vector representations of nodes in a graph, which are widely applicable in community detection, recommendations, and various scientific fields. However, existing graph embedding systems either face scalability challenges due to the high cost of RAM and multiple GPUs, or rely on disk storage at the expense of I/O efficiency. In this paper, we propose Legend, a lightweight heterogeneous system for graph embedding that systematically redefines data management across CPU, GPU, and NVMe SSD resources. Legend is built on a foundation of efficient data placement and retrieval strategies tailored to the unique strengths of each hardware. Key innovations include a prefetch-friendly embedding loading strategy, enabling GPUs to directly prefetch data from SSDs with minimal I/O overhead, and a high-throughput GPU-SSD direct access driver optimized for graph embedding tasks. Furthermore, we propose a customized parallel execution strategy to maximize GPU utilization, ensuring efficient handling of billion-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Legend achieves up to 4.8x speedup compared to state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, Legend exhibits comparable performance on a single GPU to that of the state-of-the-art system using 4 GPUs on the billion-scale dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGRec: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Federated Graph Learning for Secure and Efficient Cross-Border Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18177v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing, collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge. Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy, FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triadic Closure-Heterogeneity-Harmony GCN for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20492v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction aims to estimate the likelihood of connections between pairs of nodes in complex networks, which is beneficial to many applications from friend recommendation to metabolic network reconstruction. Traditional heuristic-based methodologies in the field of complex networks typically depend on predefined assumptions about node connectivity, limiting their generalizability across diverse networks. While recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches capture global structural features effectively, they often neglect node attributes and intrinsic structural relationships between node pairs. To address this, we propose TriHetGCN, an extension of traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates explicit topological indicators -- triadic closure and degree heterogeneity. TriHetGCN consists of three modules: topology feature construction, graph structural representation, and connection probability prediction. The topology feature module constructs node features using shortest path distances to anchor nodes, enhancing global structure perception. The graph structural module integrates topological indicators into the GCN framework to model triadic closure and heterogeneity. The connection probability module uses deep learning to predict links. Evaluated on nine real-world datasets, from traditional networks without node attributes to large-scale networks with rich features, TriHetGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming mainstream methods. This highlights its strong generalization across diverse network types, offering a promising framework that bridges statistical physics and graph deep learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces GTS-LUM, a novel user behavior model that redefines modeling paradigms in telecommunication settings. GTS-LUM adopts a (multi-modal) encoder-adapter-LLM decoder architecture, enhanced with several telecom-specific innovations. Specifically, the model incorporates an advanced timestamp processing method to handle varying time granularities. It also supports multi-modal data inputs -- including structured tables and behavior co-occurrence graphs -- and aligns these with semantic information extracted by a tokenizer using a Q-former structure. Additionally, GTS-LUM integrates a front-placed target-aware mechanism to highlight historical behaviors most relevant to the target. Extensive experiments on industrial dataset validate the effectiveness of this end-to-end framework and also demonstrate that GTS-LUM outperforms LLM4Rec approaches which are popular in recommendation systems, offering an effective and generalizing solution for user behavior modeling in telecommunications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05029v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks-based micro-video recommendation has displayed performance improvement for many kinds of recommendation tasks. However, the existing works fail to fully consider the characteristics of micro-videos, such as the high timeliness of news nature micro-video recommendation and sequential interactions of frequently changed interests. In this paper, a novel Multi-aggregator Time-warping Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MTHGNN) is proposed for personalized news nature micro-video recommendation based on sequential sessions, where characteristics of micro-videos are comprehensively studied, users' preference is mined via multi-aggregator, the temporal and dynamic changes of users' preference are captured, and timeliness is considered. Through the comparison with the state-of-the-arts, the experimental results validate the superiority of our MTHGNN model.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphRouter: A Graph-based Router for LLM Selections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03834v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing number and variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges in efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM for a given query, especially considering the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalize across new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leverage contextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their dependence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, which fully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to enhance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneous graph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented as edges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query's requirements and the LLM's capabilities. Through an innovative edge prediction mechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost of LLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations that adapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios have shown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering a minimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhanced generalization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a 9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands. This work endeavors to apply a graph-based approach for the contextual and adaptive selection of LLMs, offering insights for real-world applications. Our codes for GraphRouter is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GraphRouter.</p></details> |  |

As a result, strict requirements regarding explainability and fairness have been put in place to ensure proper treatment of all involved stakeholders. To allow for stakeholder-specific explainability, while also handling highly heterogeneous recruitment data, we propose a novel explainable multi-stakeholder job recommender system using graph neural networks: the Occupational Knowledge-based Recommender using Attention (OKRA). The proposed method is capable of providing both candidate- and company-side recommendations and explanations. We find that OKRA performs substantially better than six baselines in terms of nDCG for two datasets. Furthermore, we find that the tested models show a bias toward candidates and vacancies located in urban areas. Overall, our findings suggest that OKRA provides a balance between accuracy, explainability, and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, to be published in the proceedings of ECIR2025</p></details> |

However, the irregularity and sparsity of graph data challenge traditional computing methods, which are insufficient to meet the performance demands of GNNs. Recent research has explored parallel acceleration using CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores, but significant challenges persist: (1) kernel fusion leads to false high utilization, failing to treat CUDA and Tensor Cores as independent resources, and (2) heterogeneous cores have distinct computation preferences, causing inefficiencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes FTC-GNN, a novel acceleration framework that efficiently utilizes CUDA and Tensor Cores for GNN computation. FTC-GNN introduces (1) a collaborative design that enables the parallel utilization of CUDA and Tensor Cores and (2) a sparse-to-dense transformation strategy that assigns dense matrix operations to Tensor Cores while leveraging CUDA Cores for data management and sparse edge processing. This design optimizes GPU resource utilization and improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FTC-GNN using GCN and AGNN models across various datasets. For GCN, FTC-GNN achieves speedups of 4.90x, 7.10x, and 1.17x compared to DGL, PyG, and TC-GNN, respectively. For AGNN, it achieves speedups of 5.32x, 2.92x, and 1.02x, establishing its superiority in accelerating GNN computations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Triple Modality Fusion: Aligning Visual, Textual, and Graph Data with Large Language Models for Multi-Behavior Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12228v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing the performance of personalized recommendation systems. Traditional models, which often rely on singular data sources, lack the depth needed to accurately capture the multifaceted nature of item features and user behaviors. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-behavior recommendations, leveraging the fusion of triple-modality, which is visual, textual, and graph data through alignment with large language models (LLMs). By incorporating visual information, we capture contextual and aesthetic item characteristics; textual data provides insights into user interests and item features in detail; and graph data elucidates relationships within the item-behavior heterogeneous graphs. Our proposed model called Triple Modality Fusion (TMF) utilizes the power of LLMs to align and integrate these three modalities, achieving a comprehensive representation of user behaviors. The LLM models the user's interactions including behaviors and item features in natural languages. Initially, the LLM is warmed up using only natural language-based prompts. We then devise the modality fusion module based on cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to integrate different modalities from other models into the same embedding space and incorporate them into an LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving recommendation accuracy. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the TMF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Block Graph Neural Networks for tumor heterogeneity prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05458v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate tumor classification is essential for selecting effective treatments, but current methods have limitations. Standard tumor grading, which categorizes tumors based on cell differentiation, is not recommended as a stand-alone procedure, as some well-differentiated tumors can be malignant. Tumor heterogeneity assessment via single-cell sequencing offers profound insights but can be costly and may still require significant manual intervention. Many existing statistical machine learning methods for tumor data still require complex pre-processing of MRI and histopathological data. In this paper, we propose to build on a mathematical model that simulates tumor evolution (Ożański (2017)) and generate artificial datasets for tumor classification. Tumor heterogeneity is estimated using normalized entropy, with a threshold to classify tumors as having high or low heterogeneity. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the cut and graph generation processes from the artificial data, (2) the design of tumor features, and (3) the construction of Block Graph Neural Networks (BGNN), a Graph Neural Network-based approach to predict tumor heterogeneity. The experimental results reveal that the combination of the proposed features and models yields excellent results on artificially generated data ($89.67\%$ accuracy on the test data). In particular, in alignment with the emerging trends in AI-assisted grading and spatial transcriptomics, our results suggest that enriching traditional grading methods with birth (e.g., Ki-67 proliferation index) and death markers can improve heterogeneity prediction and enhance tumor classification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

| **[DNMDR: Dynamic Networks and Multi-view Drug Representations for Safe Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08572v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medication Recommendation (MR) is a promising research topic which booms diverse applications in the healthcare and clinical domains. However, existing methods mainly rely on sequential modeling and static graphs for representation learning, which ignore the dynamic correlations in diverse medical events of a patient's temporal visits, leading to insufficient global structural exploration on nodes. Additionally, mitigating drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is another issue determining the utility of the MR systems. To address the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes a novel MR method with the integration of dynamic networks and multi-view drug representations (DNMDR). Specifically, weighted snapshot sequences for dynamic heterogeneous networks are constructed based on discrete visits in temporal EHRs, and all the dynamic networks are jointly trained to gain both structural correlations in diverse medical events and temporal dependency in historical health conditions, for achieving comprehensive patient representations with both semantic features and structural relationships. Moreover, combining the drug co-occurrences and adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in internal view of drug molecule structure and interactive view of drug pairs, the safe drug representations are available to obtain high-quality medication combination recommendation. Finally, extensive experiments on real world datasets are conducted for performance evaluation, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DNMDR method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models with a large margin on various metrics such as PRAUC, Jaccard, DDI rates and so on.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the effect of the average clustering coefficient on topology-based link prediction in featureless graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06721v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph theory with diverse applications, including recommender systems, community detection, and identifying spurious connections. While feature-based methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on node attributes limits their applicability in featureless graphs. For such graphs, structure-based approaches, including common neighbor-based and degree-dependent methods, are commonly employed. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on graph density, with common neighbor-based algorithms performing well in dense graphs and degree-dependent methods being more suitable for sparse or tree-like graphs. Despite this, the literature lacks a clear criterion to distinguish between dense and sparse graphs. This paper introduces the average clustering coefficient as a criterion for assessing graph density to assist with the choice of link prediction algorithms. To address the scarcity of datasets for empirical analysis, we propose a novel graph generation method based on the Barabasi-Albert model, which enables controlled variation of graph density while preserving structural heterogeneity. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we establish an empirical boundary for the average clustering coefficient that facilitates the selection of effective link prediction techniques.</p></details> |  |

RecKG ensures the consistent representation of entities across different datasets, accommodating diverse attribute types for effective data integration. Through a meticulous examination of various recommender system datasets, we select attributes for RecKG, ensuring standardized formatting through consistent naming conventions. By these characteristics, RecKG can seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the discovery of additional semantic information within the integrated knowledge graph. We apply RecKG to standardize real-world datasets, subsequently developing an application for RecKG using a graph database. Finally, we validate RecKG's achievement in interoperability through a qualitative evaluation between RecKG and other studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 39th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing(SAC) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Grained Preference Enhanced Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12179v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item according to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item interactions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic heterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender system. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model heterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and modelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other hand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in interaction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced Transformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level graph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph convolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency representation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical cross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a novel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user preference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential pattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference . Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[MixRec: Heterogeneous Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13825v3)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For modern recommender systems, the use of low-dimensional latent representations to embed users and items based on their observed interactions has become commonplace. However, many existing recommendation models are primarily designed for coarse-grained and homogeneous interactions, which limits their effectiveness in two critical dimensions. Firstly, these models fail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types of user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases. Secondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive user interaction patterns. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering model MixRec that excels at disentangling users' multi-behavior interaction patterns and uncovering the latent intent factors behind each behavior. Our model achieves this by incorporating intent disentanglement and multi-behavior modeling, facilitated by a parameterized heterogeneous hypergraph architecture. Furthermore, we introduce a novel contrastive learning paradigm that adaptively explores the advantages of self-supervised data augmentation, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against data sparsity and expressiveness with relation heterogeneity. To validate the efficacy of MixRec, we conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets. The results clearly demonstrate its superior performance, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MixRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WSDM'2025</p></details> |

Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Neural Networks (HGCNs) are a novel technique that leverages the advantages of GCN and hyperbolic space, and then achieves remarkable results. However, existing HGCN methods have several drawbacks: they fail to fully leverage hyperbolic space properties due to arbitrary embedding initialization and imprecise tangent space aggregation; they overlook auxiliary information that could enrich the collaborative graph; and their training convergence is slow due to margin ranking loss and random negative sampling. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hyperbolic Graph Collaborative for Heterogeneous Recommendation (HGCH), an enhanced HGCN-based model for collaborative filtering that integrates diverse side information into a heterogeneous collaborative graph and improves training convergence speed. HGCH first preserves the long-tailed nature of the graph by initializing node embeddings with power law prior; then it aggregates neighbors in hyperbolic space using the gyromidpoint method for accurate computation; finally, it fuses multiple embeddings from different hyperbolic spaces by the gate fusion with prior. Moreover, HGCH employs a hyperbolic user-specific negative sampling to speed up convergence. We evaluate HGCH on four real datasets, and the results show that HGCH achieves competitive results and outperforms leading baselines, including HGCNs. Extensive ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24)</p></details> |

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses this gap by constructing an SDoH-enriched knowledge graph using the MIMIC-III dataset and PrimeKG. We introduce a novel fairness formulation for graph embeddings, focusing on invariance with respect to sensitive SDoH information. Via employing a heterogeneous-GCN model for drug-disease link prediction, we detect biases related to various SDoH factors. To mitigate these biases, we propose a post-processing method that strategically reweights edges connected to SDoHs, balancing their influence on graph representations. This approach represents one of the first comprehensive investigations into fairness issues within biomedical knowledge graphs incorporating SDoH. Our work not only highlights the importance of considering SDoH in medical informatics but also provides a concrete method for reducing SDoH-related biases in link prediction tasks, paving the way for more equitable healthcare recommendations.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph-based Framework with Disentangled Representations Learning for Multi-target Cross Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00909v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CDR (Cross-Domain Recommendation), i.e., leveraging information from multiple domains, is a critical solution to data sparsity problem in recommendation system. The majority of previous research either focused on single-target CDR (STCDR) by utilizing data from the source domains to improve the model's performance on the target domain, or applied dual-target CDR (DTCDR) by integrating data from the source and target domains. In addition, multi-target CDR (MTCDR) is a generalization of DTCDR, which is able to capture the link among different domains. In this paper we present HGDR (Heterogeneous Graph-based Framework with Disentangled Representations Learning), an end-to-end heterogeneous network architecture where graph convolutional layers are applied to model relations among different domains, meanwhile utilizes the idea of disentangling representation for domain-shared and domain-specifc information. First, a shared heterogeneous graph is generated by gathering users and items from several domains without any further side information. Second, we use HGDR to compute disentangled representations for users and items in all domains. Experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests prove that our proposed model can transmit information among domains effectively and reach the SOTA performance. The code can be found here: https://github.com/NetEase-Media/HGCDR.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIMBRE: Efficient Job Recommendation On Heterogeneous Graphs For Professional Recruiters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15146v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Job recommendation gathers many challenges well-known in recommender systems. First, it suffers from the cold start problem, with the user (the candidate) and the item (the job) having a very limited lifespan. It makes the learning of good user and item representations hard. Second, the temporal aspect is crucial: We cannot recommend an item in the future or too much in the past. Therefore, using solely collaborative filtering barely works. Finally, it is essential to integrate information about the users and the items, as we cannot rely only on previous interactions. This paper proposes a temporal graph-based method for job recommendation: TIMBRE (Temporal Integrated Model for Better REcommendations). TIMBRE integrates user and item information into a heterogeneous graph. This graph is adapted to allow efficient temporal recommendation and evaluation, which is later done using a graph neural network. Finally, we evaluate our approach with recommender system metrics, rarely computed on graph-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

With the surge of rich information available for entities in real-world networks, the community detection problem in attributed networks has attracted widespread attention. While previous research has effectively leveraged network topology and attribute information for attributed community detection, these methods overlook two critical issues: (i) the semantic similarity between node attributes within the community, and (ii) the inherent mesoscopic structure, which differs from the pairwise connections of the micro-structure. To address these limitations, we propose HACD, a novel attributed community detection model based on heterogeneous graph attention networks. HACD treats node attributes as another type of node, constructs attributed networks into heterogeneous graph structures and employs attribute-level attention mechanisms to capture semantic similarity. Furthermore, HACD introduces a community membership function to explore mesoscopic community structures, enhancing the robustness of detected communities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HACD, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in attributed community detection tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Anniran1/HACD1-wsdm.</p></details> |  |

Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN model parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a time-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training, it is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and patterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In this study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two mainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU distributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training scenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 14 figures, to appear in ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (ACM TACO)</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Generation: A Hierarchical Approach using Node Feature Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11972v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are present in various domains, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs consist of multiple types of nodes and edges, each representing different entities and relationships. Generating realistic heterogeneous graphs that capture the complex interactions among diverse entities is a difficult task due to several reasons. The generator has to model both the node type distribution along with the feature distribution for each node type. In this paper, we look into solving challenges in heterogeneous graph generation, by employing a two phase hierarchical structure, wherein the first phase creates a skeleton graph with node types using a prior diffusion based model and in the second phase, we use an encoder and a sampler structure as generator to assign node type specific features to the nodes. A discriminator is used to guide training of the generator and feature vectors are sampled from a node feature pool. We conduct extensive experiments with subsets of IMDB and DBLP datasets to show the effectiveness of our method and also the need for various architecture components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum-scheduled Knowledge Distillation from Multiple Pre-trained Teachers for Multi-domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00797v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained recommendation models (PRMs) have received increasing interest recently. However, their intrinsically heterogeneous model structure, huge model size and computation cost hinder their adoptions in practical recommender systems. Hence, it is highly essential to explore how to use different pre-trained recommendation models efficiently in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-scheduled knowledge distillation from multiple pre-trained teachers for multi-domain sequential recommendation, called CKD-MDSR, which takes full advantages of different PRMs as multiple teacher models to boost a small student recommendation model, integrating the knowledge across multiple domains from PRMs. Specifically, CKD-MDSR first adopts curriculum-scheduled user behavior sequence sampling and distills informative knowledge jointly from the representative PRMs such as UniSRec and Recformer. Then, the knowledge from the above PRMs are selectively integrated into the student model in consideration of their confidence and consistency. Finally, we verify the proposed method on multi-domain sequential recommendation and further demonstrate its universality with multiple types of student models, including feature interaction and graph based recommendation models. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CKD-MDSR, which can be viewed as an efficient shortcut using PRMs in real-world systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Attributed Graph Networks with Alignment and Uniformity Constraints for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10296v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based Recommendation (SBR), seeking to predict a user's next action based on an anonymous session, has drawn increasing attention for its practicability. Most SBR models only rely on the contextual transitions within a short session to learn item representations while neglecting additional valuable knowledge. As such, their model capacity is largely limited by the data sparsity issue caused by short sessions. A few studies have exploited the Modeling of Item Attributes (MIA) to enrich item representations. However, they usually involve specific model designs that can hardly transfer to existing attribute-agnostic SBR models and thus lack universality. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic framework, named AttrGAU (Attributed Graph Networks with Alignment and Uniformity Constraints), to bring the MIA's superiority into existing attribute-agnostic models, to improve their accuracy and robustness for recommendation. Specifically, we first build a bipartite attributed graph and design an attribute-aware graph convolution to exploit the rich attribute semantics hidden in the heterogeneous item-attribute relationship. We then decouple existing attribute-agnostic SBR models into the graph neural network and attention readout sub-modules to satisfy the non-intrusive requirement. Lastly, we design two representation constraints, i.e., alignment and uniformity, to optimize distribution discrepancy in representation between the attribute semantics and collaborative semantics. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed AttrGAU framework can significantly enhance backbone models' recommendation performance and robustness against data sparsity and data noise issues. Our implementation codes will be available at https://github.com/ItsukiFujii/AttrGAU.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Efficient Bipartite Graph Embedding Induced by Clustering Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09477v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bipartite graph embedding (BGE) maps nodes to compressed embedding vectors that can reflect the hidden topological features of the network, and learning high-quality BGE is crucial for facilitating downstream applications such as recommender systems. However, most existing methods either struggle to efficiently learn embeddings suitable for users and items with fewer interactions, or exhibit poor scalability to handle large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a Clustering Constraints induced BIpartite graph Embedding (CCBIE) as an integrated solution to both problems. CCBIE facilitates automatic and dynamic soft clustering of items in a top-down manner, and capturing macro-preference information of users through clusters. Specifically, by leveraging the cluster embedding matrix of items, CCBIE calculates the cluster assignment matrix for items and also captures the extent of user preferences across different clusters, thereby elucidating the similarity between users and items on a macro-scale level. CCBIE effectively preserves the global properties of bipartite graphs, maintaining the cluster structure of isomorphic nodes and accounting for long-range dependencies among heterogeneous nodes. Our approach significantly enhances user-item collaborative relation modeling by integrating adaptive clustering for relationship learning, thereby markedly improving prediction performance, particularly benefiting cold users and items. Extensive experiments indicate that CCBIE consistently and significantly improves accuracy over baseline models, particularly on sparse graphs, while also enhancing training speed and reducing memory requirements on large-scale bipartite graphs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Firzen: Firing Strict Cold-Start Items with Frozen Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Graphs for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07654v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation models utilizing unique identities (IDs) to represent distinct users and items have dominated the recommender systems literature for over a decade. Since multi-modal content of items (e.g., texts and images) and knowledge graphs (KGs) may reflect the interaction-related users' preferences and items' characteristics, they have been utilized as useful side information to further improve the recommendation quality. However, the success of such methods often limits to either warm-start or strict cold-start item recommendation in which some items neither appear in the training data nor have any interactions in the test stage: (1) Some fail to learn the embedding of a strict cold-start item since side information is only utilized to enhance the warm-start ID representations; (2) The others deteriorate the performance of warm-start recommendation since unrelated multi-modal content or entities in KGs may blur the final representations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework incorporating multi-modal content of items and KGs to effectively solve both strict cold-start and warm-start recommendation termed Firzen, which extracts the user-item collaborative information over frozen heterogeneous graph (collaborative knowledge graph), and exploits the item-item semantic structures and user-user behavioral association over frozen homogeneous graphs (item-item relation graph and user-user co-occurrence graph). Furthermore, we build four unified strict cold-start evaluation benchmarks based on publicly available Amazon datasets and a real-world industrial dataset from Weixin Channels via rearranging the interaction data and constructing KGs. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that our model yields significant improvements for strict cold-start recommendation and outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art performance in the warm-start scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

Existing NBR models often overlook a crucial factor, which is price, and do not fully capture item-basket-user interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Basket-augmented Dynamic Heterogeneous Hypergraph (BDHH). BDHH utilizes a heterogeneous multi-relational graph to capture the intricate relationships among item features, with price as a critical factor. Moreover, our approach includes a basket-guided dynamic augmentation network that could dynamically enhances item-basket-user interactions. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BDHH significantly improves recommendation accuracy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have demonstrated their superior performance across various applications, including medical analysis and recommendation systems, often surpassing existing methods. However, GPUs often experience inefficiencies when executing HGNNs due to their unique and complex execution patterns. Compared to traditional Graph Neural Networks, these patterns further exacerbate irregularities in memory access. To tackle these challenges, recent studies have focused on developing domain-specific accelerators for HGNNs. Nonetheless, most of these efforts have concentrated on optimizing the datapath or scheduling data accesses, while largely overlooking the potential benefits that could be gained from leveraging the inherent properties of the semantic graph, such as its topology, layout, and generation. In this work, we focus on leveraging the properties of semantic graphs to enhance HGNN performance. First, we analyze the Semantic Graph Build (SGB) stage and identify significant opportunities for data reuse during semantic graph generation. Next, we uncover the phenomenon of buffer thrashing during the Graph Feature Processing (GFP) stage, revealing potential optimization opportunities in semantic graph layout. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight hardware accelerator frontend for HGNNs, called SiHGNN. This accelerator frontend incorporates a tree-based Semantic Graph Builder for efficient semantic graph generation and features a novel Graph Restructurer for optimizing semantic graph layouts. Experimental results show that SiHGNN enables the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator to achieve an average performance improvement of 2.95$\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 18 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04792</p></details> |
| **[Behavior Pattern Mining-based Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12152v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-behavior recommendation systems enhance effectiveness by leveraging auxiliary behaviors (such as page views and favorites) to address the limitations of traditional models that depend solely on sparse target behaviors like purchases. Existing approaches to multi-behavior recommendations typically follow one of two strategies: some derive initial node representations from individual behavior subgraphs before integrating them for a comprehensive profile, while others interpret multi-behavior data as a heterogeneous graph, applying graph neural networks to achieve a unified node representation. However, these methods do not adequately explore the intricate patterns of behavior among users and items. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel algorithm called Behavior Pattern mining-based Multi-behavior Recommendation (BPMR). Our method extensively investigates the diverse interaction patterns between users and items, utilizing these patterns as features for making recommendations. We employ a Bayesian approach to streamline the recommendation process, effectively circumventing the challenges posed by graph neural network algorithms, such as the inability to accurately capture user preferences due to over-smoothing. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that BPMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, showing an average improvement of 268.29% in Recall@10 and 248.02% in NDCG@10 metrics. The code of our BPMR is openly accessible for use and further research at https://github.com/rookitkitlee/BPMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Reference-dependent Choices with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11302v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the classic Prospect Theory has highlighted the reference-dependent and comparative nature of consumers' product evaluation processes, few models have successfully integrated this theoretical hypothesis into data-driven preference quantification, particularly in the realm of recommender systems development. To bridge this gap, we propose a new research problem of modeling reference-dependent preferences from a data-driven perspective, and design a novel deep learning-based framework named Attributed Reference-dependent Choice Model for Recommendation (ArcRec) to tackle the inherent challenges associated with this problem. ArcRec features in building a reference network from aggregated historical purchase records for instantiating theoretical reference points, which is then decomposed into product attribute specific sub-networks and represented through Graph Neural Networks. In this way, the reference points of a consumer can be encoded at the attribute-level individually from her past experiences but also reflect the crowd influences. ArcRec also makes novel contributions to quantifying consumers' reference-dependent preferences using a deep neural network-based utility function that integrates both interest-inspired and price-inspired preferences, with their complex interaction effects captured by an attribute-aware price sensitivity mechanism. Most importantly, ArcRec introduces a novel Attribute-level Willingness-To-Pay measure to the reference-dependent utility function, which captures a consumer's heterogeneous salience of product attributes via observing her attribute-level price tolerance to a product. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world online shopping datasets demonstrate ArcRec's superior performances over fourteen state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Graph Learning with Structure Proxy Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09393v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to learn graph learning models over graph data distributed in multiple data owners, which has been applied in various applications such as social recommendation and financial fraud detection. Inherited from generic Federated Learning (FL), FGL similarly has the data heterogeneity issue where the label distribution may vary significantly for distributed graph data across clients. For instance, a client can have the majority of nodes from a class, while another client may have only a few nodes from the same class. This issue results in divergent local objectives and impairs FGL convergence for node-level tasks, especially for node classification. Moreover, FGL also encounters a unique challenge for the node classification task: the nodes from a minority class in a client are more likely to have biased neighboring information, which prevents FGL from learning expressive node embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To grapple with the challenge, we propose FedSpray, a novel FGL framework that learns local class-wise structure proxies in the latent space and aligns them to obtain global structure proxies in the server. Our goal is to obtain the aligned structure proxies that can serve as reliable, unbiased neighboring information for node classification. To achieve this, FedSpray trains a global feature-structure encoder and generates unbiased soft targets with structure proxies to regularize local training of GNN models in a personalized way. We conduct extensive experiments over four datasets, and experiment results validate the superiority of FedSpray compared with other baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/xbfu/FedSpray.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice. The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them. Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR (Multi-Task EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs. To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process. Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks -- drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission. Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

With the rapid increase in the size of the KGs, they are becoming inaccuracy and incomplete. This problem can be solved by the knowledge graph completion methods, of which graph attention network (GAT)-based methods stand out since their superior performance. However, existing GAT-based knowledge graph completion methods often suffer from overfitting issues when dealing with heterogeneous knowledge graphs, primarily due to the unbalanced number of samples. Additionally, these methods demonstrate poor performance in predicting the tail (head) entity that shares the same relation and head (tail) entity with others. To solve these problems, we propose GATH, a novel GAT-based method designed for Heterogeneous KGs. GATH incorporates two separate attention network modules that work synergistically to predict the missing entities. We also introduce novel encoding and feature transformation approaches, enabling the robust performance of GATH in scenarios with imbalanced samples. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the GATH's performance. Compared with the existing SOTA GAT-based model on Hits@10 and MRR metrics, our model improves performance by 5.2% and 5.2% on the FB15K-237 dataset, and by 4.5% and 14.6% on the WN18RR dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17234v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Learning (CL)-based recommender systems have gained prominence in the context of Heterogeneous Graph (HG) due to their capacity to enhance the consistency of representations across different views. However, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (e.g., brand preferences or demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |

To build a KG it is a common practice to rely on automatic methods for extracting knowledge from various heterogeneous sources. But in a noisy and uncertain world, knowledge may not be reliable and conflicts between data sources may occur. Integrating unreliable data would directly impact the use of the KG, therefore such conflicts must be resolved. This could be done manually by selecting the best data to integrate. This first approach is highly accurate, but costly and time-consuming. That is why recent efforts focus on automatic approaches, which represents a challenging task since it requires handling the uncertainty of extracted knowledge throughout its integration into the KG. We survey state-of-the-art approaches in this direction and present constructions of both open and enterprise KGs and how their quality is maintained. We then describe different knowledge extraction methods, introducing additional uncertainty. We also discuss downstream tasks after knowledge acquisition, including KG completion using embedding models, knowledge alignment, and knowledge fusion in order to address the problem of knowledge uncertainty in KG construction. We conclude with a discussion on the remaining challenges and perspectives when constructing a KG taking into account uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

With the development of deep learning, graph-based methods are well exploited to utilize graph structure extracted from user behaviors and other information to help embedding learning. However, most of the previous graph-based methods mainly focus on recommendation scenarios, and therefore their graph structures highly depend on item's sequential information from user behaviors, ignoring query's sequential signal and query-item correlation. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network (EGIN) to effectively mine users' search interests and tackle previous challenges. (i) EGIN utilizes query and item's correlation and sequential information from the search system to build a heterogeneous graph for better CTR prediction in e-commerce search. (ii) EGIN's graph embedding learning shares the same training input and is jointly trained with CTR prediction, making the end-to-end framework effortless to deploy in large-scale search systems. The proposed EGIN is composed of three parts: query-item heterogeneous graph, light-weight graph sampling, and multi-interest network. The query-item heterogeneous graph captures correlation and sequential information of query and item efficiently by the proposed light-weight graph sampling. The multi-interest network is well designed to utilize graph embedding to capture various similarity relationships between query and item to enhance the final CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EGIN. At the same time, the training cost of graph learning is relatively low compared with the main CTR prediction task, ensuring efficiency in practical applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03665v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage their auxiliary information. The core idea of KG-enhanced recommenders is to incorporate rich semantic information for more accurate recommendations. However, two main challenges persist: i) Neglecting complex higher-order interactions in the KG-based user-item network, potentially leading to sub-optimal recommendations, and ii) Dealing with the heterogeneous modalities of input sources, such as user-item bipartite graphs and KGs, which may introduce noise and inaccuracies. To address these issues, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Heterogeneous Hypergraph Recommender System (KHGRec). KHGRec captures group-wise characteristics of both the interaction network and the KG, modeling complex connections in the KG. Using a collaborative knowledge heterogeneous hypergraph (CKHG), it employs two hypergraph encoders to model group-wise interdependencies and ensure explainability. Additionally, it fuses signals from the input graphs with cross-view self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our model's superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines, with an average 5.18\% relative improvement. Additional tests on noise resilience, missing data, and cold-start problems demonstrate the robustness of our KHGRec framework. Our model and evaluation datasets are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/viethungvu1998/KHGRec}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Product Assortment with Real-time 3D Perception and Bayesian Payoff Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07769v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product assortment selection is a critical challenge facing physical retailers. Effectively aligning inventory with the preferences of shoppers can increase sales and decrease out-of-stocks. However, in real-world settings the problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of product assortment possibilities. Consumer preferences are typically heterogeneous across space and time, making inventory-preference alignment challenging. Additionally, existing strategies rely on syndicated data, which tends to be aggregated, low resolution, and suffer from high latency. To solve these challenges, we introduce a real-time recommendation system, which we call EdgeRec3D. Our system utilizes recent advances in 3D computer vision for perception and automatic, fine grained sales estimation. These perceptual components run on the edge of the network and facilitate real-time reward signals. Additionally, we develop a Bayesian payoff model to account for noisy estimates from 3D LIDAR data. We rely on spatial clustering to allow the system to adapt to heterogeneous consumer preferences, and a graph-based candidate generation algorithm to address the combinatorial search problem. We test our system in real-world stores across two, 6-8 week A/B tests with beverage products and demonstrate a 35% and 27% increase in sales respectively. Finally, we monitor the deployed system for a period of 28 weeks with an observational study and show a 9.4% increase in sales.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD 2024 |

With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.</p></details> |  |

As the interpretation of GNNs becomes increasingly important, the demand for robust baselines and expansive graph datasets is accentuated, particularly in the context of Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). Addressing this, we introduce SynHING, a novel framework for Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation aimed at enhancing graph learning and explanation. SynHING systematically identifies major motifs in a target HIN and employs a bottom-up generation process with intra-cluster and inter-cluster merge modules. This process, supplemented by post-pruning techniques, ensures the synthetic HIN closely mirrors the original graph's structural and statistical properties. Crucially, SynHING provides ground-truth motifs for evaluating GNN explainer models, setting a new standard for explainable, synthetic HIN generation and contributing to the advancement of interpretable machine learning in complex networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update figures, tables, and content</p></details> |

This research innovatively integrates graph neural network technology into the medical and health field, aiming to build a high-precision representation model of patient health status by mining the complex association between patients' clinical characteristics, genetic information, living habits. In this study, medical data is preprocessed to transform it into a graph structure, where nodes represent different data entities (such as patients, diseases, genes, etc.) and edges represent interactions or relationships between entities. The core of the algorithm is to design a novel multi-scale fusion mechanism, combining the historical medical records, physiological indicators and genetic characteristics of patients, to dynamically adjust the attention allocation strategy of the graph neural network, so as to achieve highly customized analysis of individual cases. In the experimental part, this study selected several publicly available medical data sets for validation, and the results showed that compared with traditional machine learning methods and a single graph neural network model, the proposed personalized medical decision algorithm showed significantly superior performance in terms of disease prediction accuracy, treatment effect evaluation and patient risk stratification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-domain Knowledge Graph Collaborative Pre-training and Prompt Tuning for Diverse Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13085v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide reliable external knowledge for a wide variety of AI tasks in the form of structured triples. Knowledge graph pre-training (KGP) aims to pre-train neural networks on large-scale KGs and provide unified interfaces to enhance different downstream tasks, which is a key direction for KG management, maintenance, and applications. Existing works often focus on purely research questions in open domains, or they are not open source due to data security and privacy in real scenarios. Meanwhile, existing studies have not explored the training efficiency and transferability of KGP models in depth. To address these problems, We propose a framework MuDoK to achieve multi-domain collaborative pre-training and efficient prefix prompt tuning to serve diverse downstream tasks like recommendation and text understanding. Our design is a plug-and-play prompt learning approach that can be flexibly adapted to different downstream task backbones. In response to the lack of open-source benchmarks, we constructed a new multi-domain KGP benchmark called KPI with two large-scale KGs and six different sub-domain tasks to evaluate our method and open-sourced it for subsequent research. We evaluated our approach based on constructed KPI benchmarks using diverse backbone models in heterogeneous downstream tasks. The experimental results show that our framework brings significant performance gains, along with its generality, efficiency, and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.
