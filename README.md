| **[AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

| **[Build the web for agents, not agents for the web](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10953v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities. Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Semantic Control for Autonomous Wireless Space Networks: Extending Space-O-RAN with MCP-Driven Distributed Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10925v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols, allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers, landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lunar...</summary><p>Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium 2025 Spring Meeting, May 20-22</p></details> |
| **[CIIR@LiveRAG 2025: Optimizing Multi-Agent Retrieval Augmented Generation through Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10844v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents mRAG, a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework composed of specialized agents for subtasks such as planning, searching, reasoning, and coordination. Our system uses a self-training paradigm with reward-guided trajectory sampling to optimize inter-agent collaboration and enhance response generation. Evaluated on DataMorgana-derived datasets during the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG competition, mRAG outperforms conventional RAG baselines. We further analyze competition outcomes and showcase the framework's strengths with case studies, demonstrating its efficacy for complex, real-world RAG tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoDeepResearch: Long Video Understanding With Agentic Tool Using](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Beamforming with Extremely Large Scale RIS: A Sequential Multi-Agent A2C Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10815v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a challenging problem to jointly optimize the base station (BS) precoding matrix and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phases simultaneously in a RIS-assisted multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario when the size of the RIS becomes extremely large. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called sequential multi-agent advantage actor-critic (A2C) to solve this problem. In addition, the discrete phase of RISs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and channel correlations between users are taken into consideration. The computational complexity is also analyzed, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer in terms of the sum spectral efficiency (SE). It is noted that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is lower than the benchmark, while the performance is better than the benchmark. Throughout simulations, it is also found that the proposed algorithm is robust to medium channel estimation error.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision for Auto Research with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18765v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Agent-Based Auto Research, a structured multi-agent framework designed to automate, coordinate, and optimize the full lifecycle of scientific research. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and modular agent collaboration, the system spans all major research phases, including literature review, ideation, methodology planning, experimentation, paper writing, peer review response, and dissemination. By addressing issues such as fragmented workflows, uneven methodological expertise, and cognitive overload, the framework offers a systematic and scalable approach to scientific inquiry. Preliminary explorations demonstrate the feasibility and potential of Auto Research as a promising paradigm for self-improving, AI-driven research processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[OPT-BENCH: Evaluating LLM Agent on Large-Scale Search Spaces Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10764v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

| **[AI Agent Behavioral Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06366v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of AI agents that exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, including planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians of the Agentic System: Preventing Many Shots Jailbreak with Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16750v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous AI agents using large language models can create undeniable values in all span of the society but they face security threats from adversaries that warrants immediate protective solutions because trust and safety issues arise. Considering the many-shot jailbreaking and deceptive alignment as some of the main advanced attacks, that cannot be mitigated by the static guardrails used during the supervised training, points out a crucial research priority for real world robustness. The combination of static guardrails in dynamic multi-agent system fails to defend against those attacks. We intend to enhance security for LLM-based agents through the development of new evaluation frameworks which identify and counter threats for safe operational deployment. Our work uses three examination methods to detect rogue agents through a Reverse Turing Test and analyze deceptive alignment through multi-agent simulations and develops an anti-jailbreaking system by testing it with GEMINI 1.5 pro and llama-3.3-70B, deepseek r1 models using tool-mediated adversarial scenarios. The detection capabilities are strong such as 94\% accuracy for GEMINI 1.5 pro yet the system suffers persistent vulnerabilities when under long attacks as prompt length increases attack success rates (ASR) and diversity metrics become ineffective in prediction while revealing multiple complex system faults. The findings demonstrate the necessity of adopting flexible security systems based on active monitoring that can be performed by the agents themselves together with adaptable interventions by system admin as the current models can create vulnerabilities that can lead to the unreliable and vulnerable system. So, in our work, we try to address such situations and propose a comprehensive framework to counteract the security issues.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonconvex Game and Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification and Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLM Systems -- Prototype and Cybersecurity Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10467v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p></details> |  |

An In-the-Wild Study on Group-Sensitive Conversation Design in Human-Agent Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10462v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs - in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN). \c{opyright} IEEE.

However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning RAG via System 1 or System 2: A Survey on Reasoning Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Industry Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10408v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection of the relevant research has been organized into a https://github.com/ByebyeMonica/Reasoning-Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirage-1: Augmenting and Updating GUI Agent with Hierarchical Multimodal Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10387v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

| **[CAF-I: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Irony Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08430v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimus-3: Towards Generalist Multimodal Minecraft Agents with Scalable Task Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10357v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

| **[The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions in Consumer Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00073v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Optimization Paradox in Clinical AI Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06574v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering, interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems (one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes, process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Channel Access in WLANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14218v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX algorithm is robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios. It coexists well with the conventional CSMA/CA mechanism and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future of Work with AI Agents: Auditing Automation and Augmentation Potential across the U.S. Workforce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06576v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light" Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.</p></details> | Preprint |

We present AURA (Attribution Using Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a multi-agent, knowledge-enhanced framework for automated and interpretable APT attribution. AURA ingests diverse threat data including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, which are processed through a network of collaborative agents. These agents are designed for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval from structured threat knowledge bases, and natural language justification of attribution decisions. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), AURA enables contextual linking of threat behaviors to known APT groups and supports traceable reasoning across multiple attack phases. Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability. This work establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent, data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10171v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.</p></details> |  |

These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.</p></details> |  |

Chat-of-Thought employs multiple collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles, leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven discussions enable iterative refinement of content.

| **[TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation, limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **["What are my options?": Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (Extended)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09901v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular, DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity. Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for exploration and adaptive planning in RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[TACTIC: Translation Agents with Cognitive-Theoretic Interactive Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08403v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiBerNAC: Hierarchical Brain-emulated Robotic Neural Agent Collective for Disentangling Complex Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08296v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |

However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID 4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Engineering for Agents: An Adaptive Cognitive Architecture for Interpretable ML Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09742v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps: Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis, and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general. The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Of particular interest is the discovery of objects that are not only innovative but also conform to the physical specifications of the real world in science and engineering. LLM2TEA comprises a large language model to initialize a population of genotypes (defined by text prompts) describing the objects of interest, a text-to-3D generative model to produce phenotypes from these prompts, a classifier to interpret the semantic representations of the objects, and a physics simulation model to assess their physical properties. We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators to guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\% to 174\% improvement in the diversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative model baseline. In addition, more than 73\% of the generated designs have better physical performance than the top 1\% percentile of the designs generated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the proposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible physical objects. The designs produced by LLM2TEA meets practical requirements while showcasing creative and innovative features, underscoring its potential applications in complex design optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for review</p></details> |

Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Red-Teaming of Policy-Adherent Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09600v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks</p></details> |  |

Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21298v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</p></details> |  |

This position paper questions whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful partnership.</p></details> |  |

However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedure (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1% and OpenVLA by 7.4% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forme...</summary><p>Former versions either contain unrelated content or cannot be properly converted to PDF</p></details> |

A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.07687</p></details> |
| **[OWL: Optimized Workforce Learning for General Multi-Agent Assistance in Real-World Task Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23885v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/camel-ai/owl</p></details> |
| **[Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Emergent Machina Sapiens Urge Rethinking Multi-Agent Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04388v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[UTBoost: Rigorous Evaluation of Coding Agents on SWE-Bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09289v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections, impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-based Condition Monitoring Assistance with Multimodal Industrial Database Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09247v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation, and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading to increased workload and reduced efficiency. This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets. The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios. Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst, indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Agent Planning with In-Context Learning via Atomic Fact Augmentation and Lookahead Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09171v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks, achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.</p></details> | <details><summary>9-pag...</summary><p>9-page main paper, 1 figure.

| **[PatchPilot: A Cost-Efficient Software Engineering Agent with Early Attempts on Formal Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02747v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and rule-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Rule-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel rule-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/PatchPilot.</p></details> |  |
| **[MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174v4)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.</p></details> |  |

The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre), model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end (human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages, under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic, interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment.

However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.</p></details> |  |

While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines.

We run six different scenarios to explore the competition between cancer and immune cells and the initial concentration of the immune cells on cancer dynamics. We then use coupled equation learning to construct a population-based reaction model for each scenario. We show how they can be unified into a single surrogate population-based reaction model, whose underlying three coupled ordinary differential equations are much easier to analyse than the original agent-based model. As an example, by finding the single steady state of the cancer concentration, we are able to find a linear relationship between this concentration and the initial concentration of the immune cells. This then enables us to estimate suitable values for the competition and initial concentration to reduce the cancer substantially without performing additional complex and expensive simulations from an agent-based stochastic model.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures; This version is identical to the one published at Frontiers</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.</p></details> |  |

The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

| **[Thinking vs. Doing: Agents that Reason by Scaling Test-Time Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07976v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typo in Figure 6 and Conclusion</p></details> |

Expert knowledge and qualitative insights, such as those obtained through interviews, ethnographic research, historical accounts, or participatory workshops, are critical in constructing realistic behavioral rules, interactions, and decision-making processes within these models. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches that are able to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data across the entire modeling cycle. To address this, we propose FREIDA (FRamework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models), a systematic mixed-methods framework to develop, train, and validate ABMs, particularly in data-sparse contexts. Our main technical innovation is to extract what we call Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) from qualitative data, which are testable statements that can be evaluated on model simulations. Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data. In this way, qualitative insights can inform not only model specification but also its parameterization and assessment of fitness for purpose, which is a long standing challenge. We illustrate the application of FREIDA through a case study of criminal cocaine networks in the Netherlands.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 15 tables, Appendix I-II</p></details> |
| **[Improved LLM Agents for Financial Document Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08726v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.</p></details> |  |

Particularly in the travel and hotel booking sector, these autonomous systems influence the effectiveness of traditional advertising formats. While visual cues and emotional appeals sway human users, AI agents prioritize structured data such as price, availability, and specifications. This study examines how different AI agents interact with online advertising, whether they incorporate ads into their decision-making processes, and which ad formats prove most effective. We analyze interaction patterns, click behavior, and decision-making strategies through experiments with multimodal language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our findings reveal that AI agents neither ignore nor systematically avoid advertisements but instead favor certain features-particularly keywords and structured data. These insights have significant implications for the future design of advertising strategies in AI-dominated digital environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Predictability Awareness for Efficient and Robust Multi-Agent Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06223v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To safely and efficiently solve motion planning problems in multi-agent settings, most approaches attempt to solve a joint optimization that explicitly accounts for the responses triggered in other agents. This often results in solutions with an exponential computational complexity, making these methods intractable for complex scenarios with many agents. While sequential predict-and-plan approaches are more scalable, they tend to perform poorly in highly interactive environments. This paper proposes a method to improve the interactive capabilities of sequential predict-and-plan methods in multi-agent navigation problems by introducing predictability as an optimization objective. We interpret predictability through the use of general prediction models, by allowing agents to predict themselves and estimate how they align with these external predictions. We formally introduce this behavior through the free-energy of the system, which reduces under appropriate bounds to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between plan and prediction, and use this as a penalty for unpredictable trajectories.The proposed interpretation of predictability allows agents to more robustly leverage prediction models, and fosters a soft social convention that accelerates agreement on coordination strategies without the need of explicit high level control or communication. We show how this predictability-aware planning leads to lower-cost trajectories and reduces planning effort in a set of multi-robot problems, including autonomous driving experiments with human driver data, where we show that the benefits of considering predictability apply even when only the ego-agent uses this strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and other additional materials can be found at https://romanchiva.github.io/PAProjectPage/</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Bias Reinforcement in LLM Agents Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Learning to Lead: Incentivizing Strategic Agents in the Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08438v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model, where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal, observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic agents.</p></details> | 81 pages, 7 figures |

Among various methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically, DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution. Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2025</p></details> |

Previous work has mainly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy. In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context. A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior. However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method. Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios. Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.</p></details> | Typos corrected |
| **[ORFS-agent: Tool-Using Agents for Chip Design Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08332v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Software Engineering Agents Through the Lens of Traceability: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08311v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents (SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work, we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2) using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation -- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned with human development practices.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward, conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically, ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models, confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/ECON.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness. This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-2025), pages 1996--2005, May 19-23, Detroit, Michigan, USA</p></details> |

We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99% ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper had been accepted by the 2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA)</p></details> |

The benchmark comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability. Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding, plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed for economic web intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle with executing complex, long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation. Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents. Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench with SOPs from their industrial domains.</p></details> | Under review |

While advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12 participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific support for construction workers.</p></details> |  |
| **[$τ^2$-Bench: Evaluating Conversational Agents in a Dual-Control Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07982v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions: 1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that tests both agent coordination and communication, 2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity, 3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity, 4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination. In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and guide user actions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |

While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Numeric Rewards: In-Context Dueling Bandits with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01887v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that the top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithm support with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an agentic framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of general-purpose LLMs generalized to in-context decision-making tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07829v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.</p></details> |  |

While the evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach, exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex agent ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |

This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Large Language Models for Misinformation Detection in Low-Resource Linguistic Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01587v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning Based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call {\em affect}). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively. This project is available at https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |

While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values.

Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Misinformation Detection by Visiting Potential Commonsense Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21604v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Internet technology has led to an increased prevalence of misinformation, causing severe negative effects across diverse domains. To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

| **[A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Cognition and Emotion: Empathy-Driven Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17332v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation. Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |

To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Machine Learning for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12215v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on the Role of Crowds in Combating Online Misinformation: Annotators, Evaluators, and Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02095v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online misinformation poses a global risk with significant real-world consequences. To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD) Journal.

We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |

We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **["Image, Tell me your story!" Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.

| **[Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PACIS 2024. 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/CrowdShield.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Why Misinformation is Created? Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |

Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</p></details> |  |

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |

Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |

Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |

Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |

One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human judgment.

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, it is uncertain how the public may react to labels by automated fact-checkers. In this study, we investigate the use of automated warning labels derived from misinformation detection literature and investigate their effects on three forms of post engagement. Focusing on political posts, we also consider how partisanship affects engagement. In a two-phases within-subjects experiment with 200 participants, we found that the generic warnings suppressed intents to comment on and share posts, but not on the intent to like them. Furthermore, when different reasons for the labels were provided, their effects on post engagement were inconsistent, suggesting that the reasons could have undesirably motivated engagement instead. Partisanship effects were observed across the labels with higher engagement for politically congruent posts. We discuss the implications on the design and use of automated warning labels.</p></details> |  |

Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024</p></details> |

At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Furthermore, studies on what deep neural models pay attention to when making predictions have increased in recent years.

Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is discussed on publicly available datasets and the findings are evaluated with related studies.</p></details> |  |

The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at K-CAP'23: The 12th Knowledge Capture Conference</p></details> |

Considerable efforts have focused on building misinformation detection models, still the perils of misinformation remain abound. Mitigating online misinformation and its ramifications requires a holistic approach that encompasses not only an understanding of its intricate landscape in relation to the complex issue and topic-rich information ecosystem online, but also the psychological drivers of individuals behind it. Adopting a time series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we conduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19 tweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the behavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19 and its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing misinformation on Non-COVID domains before the pandemic. Our analysis underscores the intricacies inherent to cross-domain misinformation, and highlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is positively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation sharing on emergent topics and beyond. This work may serve as a valuable foundation for designing user-centric inoculation strategies and ecologically-grounded agile interventions for effectively tackling online misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios. Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring Decomposition Attacks in LLMs with Lightweight Sequential Monitors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10949v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent, leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87% attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents. To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate, beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

| **[Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10922v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%, always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise, especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced, multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |

Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores. We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings. A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas: language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of a paper accepted at AIED 2025.

| **[ReCUT: Balancing Reasoning Length and Accuracy in LLMs via Stepwise Trails and Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10822v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.</p></details> |  |

However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks.

| **[TaxoAdapt: Aligning LLM-Based Multidimensional Taxonomy Construction to Evolving Research Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10737v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions.

However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that, although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct "breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.</p></details> |  |

During this interaction, the system should understand the users' search intent within the conversational context and then return the relevant information through a flexible, dialogue-based interface. The recent powerful large language models (LLMs) with capacities of instruction following, content generation, and reasoning, attract significant attention and advancements, providing new opportunities and challenges for building up intelligent conversational search systems. This tutorial aims to introduce the connection between fundamentals and the emerging topics revolutionized by LLMs in the context of conversational search. It is designed for students, researchers, and practitioners from both academia and industry.

| **[Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Introducing Chain & Hash, An LLM Fingerprinting Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10887v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growing concerns over the theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) have heightened the need for effective fingerprinting, which links a model to its original version to detect misuse. In this paper, we define five key properties for a successful fingerprint: Transparency, Efficiency, Persistence, Robustness, and Unforgeability. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that provides verifiable proof of ownership while maintaining fingerprint integrity. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we propose a Chain and Hash technique that cryptographically binds fingerprint prompts with their responses, ensuring no adversary can generate colliding fingerprints and allowing model owners to irrefutably demonstrate their creation. Second, we address a realistic threat model in which instruction-tuned models' output distribution can be significantly altered through meta-prompts. By integrating random padding and varied meta-prompt configurations during training, our method preserves fingerprint robustness even when the model's output style is significantly modified. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework offers strong security for proving ownership and remains resilient against benign transformations like fine-tuning, as well as adversarial attempts to erase fingerprints. Finally, we also demonstrate its applicability to fingerprinting LoRA adapters.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article published in ICWSM'25 - 19th AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media.

Logical relational reasoning is important for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1) Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3) Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models' self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B, O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring deeper logical planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Reasoning Path: Distilling Effective Guidance for LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10508v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs are usually served from cloud data centers, mission-critical and privacy-sensitive applications may require local hosting of open LLM models. Given the large GPU memory footprint needed for LLMs, edge accelerators such as Nvidia Jetson Orin AGX with 64GB of shared GPU-CPU RAM are a compelling choice. However, the feasibility and performance of LLM inference on edge accelerators is under-explored. This study presents a detailed evaluation of LLM inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX, on four SOTA models ranging from 2.7B to 32.8B parameters, such as Meta Llama3.1, Microsoft-Phi2, Deepseek-R1-Qwen. We investigate the impact of varying batch sizes, sequence lengths, and quantization levels on latency, throughput, and perplexity, and also explore various custom power modes on the Orin AGX to perform power and energy consumption analysis. Our findings offer interesting insights on the trade-offs between efficiency, inference speed and resource use, e.g., increasing the sequence length causes a decrease in token throughput and quantization causes smaller LLMs to be slower. These results can help optimize LLM serving on edge accelerators for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper to appear in PAISE 2025: Mayank Arya and Yogesh Simmhan, "Understanding the Performance and Power of LLM Inferencing on Edge Accelerators" in 7th Workshop on Parallel AI and Systems for the Edge, Co-located with IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2025</p></details> |

Although recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from episodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory. It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition, synergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with context-aware, experience-driven prompts. Experiments on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark demonstrate that ExpeRepair achieves a pass@1 score of 49.3% with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming all state-of-the-art open-source methods.</p></details> |  |

However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe, with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.</p></details> |  |

For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p></details> |  |

Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM that surpass GPT-4o.

We conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs, ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Existing solutions to this verification challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.</p></details> |  |

NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11343v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</p></details> |  |

These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench-TMDB demonstrate the superiority of CodeTool over existing approaches.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Code Execution as Grounded Supervision for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10343v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amulet: ReAlignment During Test Time for Personalized Preference Adaptation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19148v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://zowiezhang.github.io/projects/Amulet</p></details> |
| **[Towards Holistic Visual Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Videos: A LLM-Based Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04715v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks. Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge: Track 2 AI Generated video, demonstrating its effectiveness.

The primary mechanism for achieving this is through the preparation of Environmental Assessments (EAs) and, for significant impacts, comprehensive Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Large Language Model (LLM)s' effectiveness in specialized domains like NEPA remains untested for adoption in federal decision-making processes. To address this gap, we present NEPA Question and Answering Dataset (NEPAQuAD), the first comprehensive benchmark derived from EIS documents, along with a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline, MAPLE, to assess LLM performance on NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks. Our benchmark leverages actual EIS documents to create diverse question types, ranging from factual to complex problem-solving ones. We built a modular and transparent evaluation pipeline to test both closed- and open-source models in zero-shot or context-driven QA benchmarks. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs using our framework to assess both their prior knowledge and their ability to process NEPA-specific information. The experimental results reveal that all the models consistently achieve their highest performance when provided with the gold passage as context. While comparing the other context-driven approaches for each model, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approaches substantially outperform PDF document contexts, indicating that neither model is well suited for long-context question-answering tasks. Our analysis suggests that NEPA-focused regulatory reasoning tasks pose a significant challenge for LLMs, particularly in terms of understanding the complex semantics and effectively processing the lengthy regulatory documents.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We introduce `paired completion', a novel approach using LLM next-token log probabilities to detect contrasting frames using minimal examples. Through extensive evaluation across synthetic datasets and a human-labeled corpus, we demonstrate that paired completion is a cost-efficient, low-bias alternative to both prompt-based and embedding-based methods, offering a scalable solution for analyzing issue framing in large text collections, especially suited to low-resource settings.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |

Instead of directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various unseen instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scheduled Interleaved Speech-Text Training for Speech-to-Speech Translation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10299v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances, especially for languages with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of LLMs for mathematical problem solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00309v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09688v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input context in order to perform complex tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations in order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length. We evaluate our method on long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1$\times$ reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8$\times$ reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models. Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4$\times$ speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.

However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Modes of LLMs for Causal Reasoning on Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23884v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |

Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In 20...</summary><p>In 2025 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)</p></details> |

Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Long Paper</p></details> |

Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of 2025 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source, black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts. This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text. To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, and 9 tables</p></details> |

This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations, and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report v1 (21 pages, 14 figures)</p></details> |

However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v6)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, VLDB 2025</p></details> |

Insufficient SRL skills can lead to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management, undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models (LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills within the SRLAgent group (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper learning and metacognitive skill development.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We derive the necessary formulations to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating likelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous progression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play by design, making it readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for any re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through intermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods in English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context learning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware and long-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to 17.7\%.</p></details> |  |

Manual approaches face difficulties in maintaining consistent multilingual terminology. To address this, we introduce LLM-BT, a back-translation framework powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to automate terminology verification and standardization through cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) term-level consistency validation: by performing English -> intermediate language -> English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term consistency across different models (such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Grok). Case studies demonstrate over 90 percent of terms are preserved either exactly or semantically; (2) multi-path verification workflow: we develop a novel pipeline described as Retrieve -> Generate -> Verify -> Optimize, which supports both serial paths (e.g., English -> Simplified Chinese -> Traditional Chinese -> English) and parallel paths (e.g., English -> Chinese / Portuguese -> English). BLEU scores and term-level accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual robustness, with BLEU scores exceeding 0.45 and Portuguese term accuracy reaching 100 percent; (3) back-translation as semantic embedding: we reinterpret back-translation as a form of dynamic semantic embedding that uncovers latent trajectories of meaning. In contrast to static embeddings, LLM-BT offers transparent, path-based embeddings shaped by the evolution of the models. This reframing positions back-translation as an active mechanism for multilingual terminology standardization, fostering collaboration between machines and humans - machines preserve semantic integrity, while humans provide cultural interpretation.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>For G...</summary><p>For Github code see https://github.com/vdlad/Remarkable-Robustness-of-LLMs. Send all correspondence to the first author</p></details> |

Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation. To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS) is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted but pre-reviewed version of the chapter that has been accepted for publication in the Springer volume 'Decision-Making in Computational Intelligence-Based Systems,' edited by Witold Pedrycz, Gilberto Rivera, Rose Ma Rodriguez, and Salvador Ibarra Martinez.

Counterintuitively, we find that hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable solution for hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among publicly available approaches.

However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical.In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18 instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects. However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 20th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA) at ACL 2025</p></details> |

Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance.

In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and diversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and efficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and selective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across different model architectures and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o with substantially fewer computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Biased LLMs' decisions and misinformation undermine democratic processes, and existing trust models fail to address the intricacies of trust in LLMs. Currently, oversimplified, one-directional approaches have largely overlooked the many relationships between trustor (user) contextual factors (e.g. ideology, perceptions) and trustee (LLMs) systemic elements (e.g. scientists, tool's features). In this work, we introduce a bowtie model for holistically conceptualizing and formulating trust in LLMs, with a core component comprehensively exploring trust by tying its two sides, namely the trustor and the trustee, as well as their intricate relationships. We uncover these relationships within the proposed bowtie model and beyond to its sociotechnical ecosystem, through a mixed-methods explanatory study, that exploits a political discourse analysis tool (integrating ChatGPT), by exploring and responding to the next critical questions: 1) How do trustor's contextual factors influence trust-related actions? 2) How do these factors influence and interact with trustee systemic elements? 3) How does trust itself vary across trustee systemic elements? Our bowtie-based explanatory analysis reveals that past experiences and familiarity significantly shape trustor's trust-related actions; not all trustor contextual factors equally influence trustee systemic elements; and trustee's human-in-the-loop features enhance trust, while lack of transparency decreases it. Finally, this solid evidence is exploited to deliver recommendations, insights and pathways towards building robust trusting ecosystems in LLM-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The 2025 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '25).

| **[In-Context Bias Propagation in LLM-Based Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09630v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with in sensitive domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICML 2025 workshop DIG-BUG</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Debiasing Methods for LLM-based Parameter Estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09627v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL) and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTAGEN: Empirical Evaluation of Automated SATD Taxonomy Generation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09601v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technical debt refers to suboptimal code that degrades software quality. When developers intentionally introduce such debt, it is called self-admitted technical debt (SATD). Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its categories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing such taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding code, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to annotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward automating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a comment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation for each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to construct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains: quantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully recovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer Configuration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN produces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven, iterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and for less than one USD, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that while full automation remains challenging, ASTAGEN is able to support semi-automated taxonomy construction. Furthermore, our work opens up avenues for future work, such as automatic taxonomy generation in other areas.</p></details> |  |

The integration of these models in robotics can also help to improve several aspects such as human-robot interaction, navigation, planning and decision-making. Therefore, this paper introduces llama\_ros, a tool designed to integrate quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotic systems using ROS 2. Leveraging llama.cpp, a highly optimized runtime engine, llama\_ros enables the efficient execution of quantized LLMs as edge artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics systems with resource-constrained environments, addressing the challenges of computational efficiency and memory limitations. By deploying quantized LLMs, llama\_ros empowers robots to leverage the natural language understanding and generation for enhanced decision-making and interaction which can be paired with prompt engineering, knowledge graphs, ontologies or other tools to improve the capabilities of autonomous robots. Additionally, this paper provides insights into some use cases of using llama\_ros for planning and explainability in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to 3rd edition of the Workshop on Ontologies and Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA) at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unable to Forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Because the LLMs cannot currently reliably identify the origin of the information used to construct the response to the user prompt, our approach is to avoid using internal LLM factual knowledge altogether. Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks of external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess the possible application of this retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88 %, and recall is 44 %. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We also evaluated the method on the SNLI dataset, which allowed us to compare our approach with models specifically tuned for the natural language inference task. We demonstrate the method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve statements needing verification. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs could be used for large-scale verification of statements in KGs, a task previously unfeasible due to human annotation costs.</p></details> |  |

To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.</p></details> |  |

Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

| **[LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |

As social media becomes central to daily life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior. Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches: computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach, a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital behavior and clinical insights. * Within-group changes in relation to the suicide attempt.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios.

For example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the 29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely spurious reward signals.</p></details> |  |

However, almost all analyses have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely independent of the speech material used during pretraining.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate how word segmentation can be used as a phonological probing task, allowing us to study the representations learned by phoneme-based language models trained on child-directed speech across 31 languages. Following computational models of word segmentation, we present unsupervised methods for extracting word boundaries from a trained model using the observation that prediction-error peaks at the start of words. We also use linear probes to identify that these models implicitly track word boundaries, even when they do not appear in training. This cross-lingual work corroborates statistical learning theories of acquisition and empirically motivates new methods for training subword tokenizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoNLL 2025</p></details> |

The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> |

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |

Early identification is necessary to prompt intervention, but it remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Hierarchical Latent Capabilities of Language Models via Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10378v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges, including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings: specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.</p></details> |  |

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.

Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications.

The majority of models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and regret precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Predictive Representations for Combinatorial Generalization in Behavioral Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10137v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence, encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD) learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also, results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.</p></details> |  |

It is nonetheless challenging to adapt such methods to a distributed system with unlabeled, private, and heterogeneous client data due to user styles and preferences. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between local clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning studies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work on solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a decentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel method, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local style information with local content information for contrastive learning, and to learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for downstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original local data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images). Through extensive experiments with linear evaluations in both IID and non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedStyle outperforms both the generalization baseline methods and personalization baseline methods in a stylized decentralized setting. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate our design of style infusion and stylized personalization improve performance significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Refor...</summary><p>Reformat to CVPR format</p></details> |

A deep neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image clustering applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, experimental study on deep clustering with autoencoders</p></details> |
| **[Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.</p></details> | 45 pages,41 figures |

Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09891v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response appropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with contexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics struggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in handling adversarial negative examples. We propose a novel evaluation framework that integrates Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) enhanced domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. Our SLMs explicitly incorporate AMR graph information through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning, while both SLM predictions and AMR knowledge are integrated into LLM prompts for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our comprehensive ablation studies reveal that AMR graph information contributes substantially more to performance improvements. Our framework achieves strong correlations with human judgments across multiple datasets, establishing a new benchmark for dialogue evaluation. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video2BEV: Transforming Drone Videos to BEVs for Video-based Geo-localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13610v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Supervised Contrastive learning: A Projection Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09810v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However, supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the foundational contrastive objective.</p></details> |  |

However, many real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness highlights the need for more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09682v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade, representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However, most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart, often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGAE: Diffusion-Guided Autoencoder for Efficient Latent Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09644v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Normalization Prevents Collapse of Non-contrastive Learning Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16109v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework, where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al. (2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2 loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus, we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Inspired Fair Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17373v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal recommendations (MMR) have gained increasing attention for alleviating the data sparsity problem of traditional recommender systems by incorporating modality-based representations. Although MMR exhibits notable improvement in recommendation accuracy, we empirically validate that an increase in the quantity or variety of modalities leads to a higher degree of users' sensitive information leakage due to entangled causal relationships, risking fair representation learning. On the other hand, existing fair representation learning approaches are mostly based on the assumption that sensitive information is solely leaked from users' interaction data and do not explicitly model the causal relationships introduced by multimodal data, which limits their applicability in multimodal scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel fair multimodal recommendation approach (dubbed FMMRec) through causality-inspired fairness-oriented modal disentanglement and relation-aware fairness learning. Particularly, we disentangle biased and filtered modal embeddings inspired by causal inference techniques, enabling the mining of modality-based unfair and fair user-user relations, thereby enhancing the fairness and informativeness of user representations. By addressing the causal effects of sensitive attributes on user preferences, our approach aims to achieve counterfactual fairness in multimodal recommendations. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FMMRec relative to the state-of-the-art baselines.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets and models validate the proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update to ICLR 2024 manuscript (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZWzUA9zeAg), add leafy spurge citations</p></details> |

These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence. Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool for representation learning.

QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, quantum architecture search, unsupervised representation learning</p></details> |

By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

| **[MOBODY: Model Based Off-Dynamics Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08460v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets. We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The generalization of set, fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE), satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.</p></details> |  |

While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Language Embedding Meets Dynamic Graph: A New Exploration for Neural Architecture Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07735v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications. Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress in representation learning. However, current methods still have some limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information, which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures, resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Feature-Based Lie Group Transformer for Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04668v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background. We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, the dataset used in this work is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaSWNN2GEyV3zQPeGya4Mr9DDhJ7OMz7/view?usp=sharing</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting the Semantic Knowledge of Pre-trained Text-Encoders for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01076v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on fixed datasets but struggle with incremental and shifting data in real-world scenarios. Continual learning addresses this challenge by allowing models to learn from new data while retaining previously learned knowledge. Existing methods mainly rely on visual features, often neglecting the rich semantic information encoded in text. The semantic knowledge available in the label information of the images, offers important semantic information that can be related with previously acquired knowledge of semantic classes. Consequently, effectively leveraging this information throughout continual learning is expected to be beneficial. To address this, we propose integrating semantic guidance within and across tasks by capturing semantic similarity using text embeddings. We start from a pre-trained CLIP model, employ the \emph{Semantically-guided Representation Learning (SG-RL)} module for a soft-assignment towards all current task classes, and use the Semantically-guided Knowledge Distillation (SG-KD) module for enhanced knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on general and fine-grained datasets. Our code can be found in https://github.com/aprilsveryown/semantically-guided-continual-learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Achieving Perfect Multimodal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15352v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal alignment constructs a joint latent vector space where modalities representing the same concept map to neighboring latent vectors. We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that, under certain conditions, paired data from each modality can map to equivalent latent vectors, which we refer to as perfect alignment. When perfect alignment cannot be achieved, it can be approximated using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a multimodal data matrix. Experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment method compared to a learned contrastive alignment method. We further demonstrate the practical application of cross-modal transfer for human action recognition, showing that perfect alignment significantly enhances the model's accuracy. We conclude by discussing how these findings can be applied to various modalities and tasks and the limitations of our method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of perfect alignment and its applications in representation learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates \emph{data-centric interpretability} in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of \emph{support samples}-those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation. These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2025(Main Conference)</p></details> |

Typical training processes of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria: uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Text-Attributed Graph Learning through Selective Annotation and Graph Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07168v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated, demonstrating its high efficiency.</p></details> | 23 pages |

MLMs are trained by randomly masking portions of the input sequences with [MASK] tokens and learning to reconstruct the original content based on the remaining context. This paper explores the impact of [MASK] tokens on MLMs. Analytical studies show that masking tokens can introduce the corrupted semantics problem, wherein the corrupted context may convey multiple, ambiguous meanings. This problem is also a key factor affecting the performance of MLMs on downstream tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a novel enhanced-context MLM, ExLM. Our approach expands [MASK] tokens in the input context and models the dependencies between these expanded states. This enhancement increases context capacity and enables the model to capture richer semantic information, effectively mitigating the corrupted semantics problem during pre-training. Experimental results demonstrate that ExLM achieves significant performance improvements in both text modeling and SMILES modeling tasks. Further analysis confirms that ExLM enriches semantic representations through context enhancement, and effectively reduces the semantic multimodality commonly observed in MLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures; ICML 2025</p></details> |

The task presents significant difficulties for protein language models (PLMs) due to the sheer volume of functional annotation categories and the highly imbalanced distribution of annotated instances across biological ontologies. Inspired by the remarkable success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in large language model (LLM) alignment, we propose AnnoDPO, a novel multi-modal framework for protein function prediction that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance annotation learning. Our methodology addresses the dual challenges of annotation scarcity and category imbalance through preference-aligned training objectives, establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Cross-Modal Representations with MLLM Priors via Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06970v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training, which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally, this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Employing Discrete Fourier Transform in Representational Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06765v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation learning via input reconstruction is a common technique in machine learning for generating representations that can be effectively utilized by arbitrary downstream tasks. A well-established approach is using autoencoders to extract latent representations at the network's compression point. These representations are valuable because they retain essential information necessary for reconstructing the original input from the compressed latent space. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective. Instead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful global information at each frequency level, making individual frequency components useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with multidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling selective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in the computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in their frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently contain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies rather than the entire spectrum. These characteristics position the DFT as a viable learning objective for representation learning and we validate our approach by achieving 52.8% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 and outperforming the traditional autoencoder by 12.8 points under identical architectural configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate that training on only the lower-frequency components - those with the highest magnitudes yields results comparable to using the full frequency spectrum, with only minimal reductions in accuracy.</p></details> | Preprint |

While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</p></details> |  |

However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConTEB (Context-aware Text Embedding Benchmark), a benchmark designed to evaluate retrieval models on their ability to leverage document-wide context. Our results show that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle in retrieval scenarios where context is required. To address this limitation, we propose InSeNT (In-sequence Negative Training), a novel contrastive post-training approach which combined with late chunking pooling enhances contextual representation learning while preserving computational efficiency. Our method significantly improves retrieval quality on ConTEB without sacrificing base model performance. We further find chunks embedded with our method are more robust to suboptimal chunking strategies and larger retrieval corpus sizes.

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters.

While this approach has shown promising results, we hypothesize that its effectiveness may be limited by optimization challenges during early training stages, where models are expected to learn complex image distributions from partial observations before developing basic visual processing capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a prototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning process to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in the dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that gradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient learning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we demonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both training efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially fewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding. Our findings suggest that carefully controlling the order of training examples plays a crucial role in self-supervised visual learning, providing a practical solution to the early-stage optimization challenges in MIM.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Self-Supervised Generative-Contrastive Learning of Multi-Modal Euclidean Input for 3D Shape Latent Representations: A Dynamic Switching Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04612v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a combined generative and contrastive neural architecture for learning latent representations of 3D volumetric shapes. The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel dynamic switching approach is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching approach also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[WhisQ: Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Text-to-Music MOS Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05899v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA. Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.</p></details> | 3 pages |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[RB-SCD: A New Benchmark for Semantic Change Detection of Roads and Bridges in Traffic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13212v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid modernization of urban transportation, accurately detecting changes such as road and bridge construction, renovation, and demolition is crucial for urban planning and traffic management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained semantic changes in complex traffic scenes, largely due to the lack of high-quality annotated change detection (CD) datasets. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images. RB-SCD spans diverse geographic areas and includes a wide variety of road and bridge types across over ten cities in multiple countries. It covers 11 distinct categories of semantic changes, enabling detailed structural and functional analysis. Based on this challenging dataset, we propose a novel framework called the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). For the first time, MFDCD integrates multimodal feature characteristics in the frequency domain. It comprises two key components: the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) and the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF). DFC couples hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, enhancing the perception of fine-grained and cross-temporal structural changes. TFF transforms textual features extracted by the CLIP model into the frequency domain via Fourier transform and applies graph-based filtering to extract salient frequency responses. These are then fused with visual features to enable effective multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments show that MFDCD achieves strong performance on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks. The RB-SCD dataset, with its rich and diverse annotations, serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in road and bridge change detection under complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable machine learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Positional Encoding meets Persistent Homology on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05814v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE (Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph representation learning.

We introduce in this paper an efficient training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM, GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that, GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative mechanisms of CLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages main article, 21 pages total</p></details> |
| **[Two-dimensional Taxonomy for N-ary Knowledge Representation Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05626v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast, hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e., translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less, position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing the Invisible: Machine learning-Based QPI Kernel Extraction via Latent Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05325v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen kernels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05236v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec (iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Multimodal Representations through an Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04870v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper, we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this regularization term.</p></details> |  |

In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |

These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00401v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models.

| **[Linear Representation Transferability Hypothesis: Leveraging Small Models to Steer Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00653v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Image Alignment with Fixed Text Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04209v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning language-aligned visual representations.</p></details> |  |

A plethora of methods have been proposed focusing on improving VAEs, with the incorporation of adversarial objectives and the integration of prior learning mechanisms being prominent directions. When it comes to the former, an indicative instance is the recently introduced family of Introspective VAEs aiming at ensuring that a low likelihood is assigned to unrealistic samples. In this study, we focus on the Soft-IntroVAE (S-IntroVAE), one of only two members of the Introspective VAE family, the other being the original IntroVAE. We select S-IntroVAE for its state-of-the-art status and its training stability. In particular, we investigate the implication of incorporating a multimodal and trainable prior into this S-IntroVAE. Namely, we formulate the prior as a third player and show that when trained in cooperation with the decoder constitutes an effective way for prior learning, which shares the Nash Equilibrium with the vanilla S-IntroVAE. Furthermore, based on a modified formulation of the optimal ELBO in S-IntroVAE, we develop theoretically motivated regularizations, namely (i) adaptive variance clipping to stabilize training when learning the prior and (ii) responsibility regularization to discourage the formation of inactive prior modes. Finally, we perform a series of targeted experiments on a 2D density estimation benchmark and in an image generation setting comprised of the (F)-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrating the effect of prior learning in S-IntroVAE in generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARL: Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning for an Interpretable Performance Predictor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04001v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However, most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant (non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For instance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS.</p></details> |  |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  |

While existing solutions have produced promising results, an issue is their fixed formation of regions and fixed input region features, which may not suit the needs of different downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a model named FlexiReg for urban region representation learning that is flexible with both the formation of urban regions and the input region features. FlexiReg is based on a spatial grid partitioning over the spatial area of interest. It learns representations for the grid cells, leveraging publicly accessible data, including POI, land use, satellite imagery, and street view imagery.

Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural program. Extensive experiments further suggest that current self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on the semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.</p></details> | <details><summary>SynDa...</summary><p>SynData4CV @ CVPR2025 | Project Page: https://point-mae-zero.cs.virginia.edu/</p></details> |

Moreover, as indicated by many empirical studies, some components of transformer architectures may be redundant. To derive a fully interpretable transformer architecture with only necessary components, we contend that the goal of representation learning is to compress a set of noisy initial token representations towards a mixture of low-dimensional subspaces. To compress these noisy token representations, an associated denoising operation naturally takes the form of a multi-head (subspace) self-attention. By unrolling such iterative denoising operations into a deep network, we arrive at a highly compact architecture that consists of \textit{only} self-attention operators with skip connections at each layer. Moreover, we show that each layer performs highly efficient denoising: it improves the signal-to-noise ratio of token representations \textit{at a linear rate} with respect to the number of layers. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on vision and language tasks demonstrate that such a transformer achieves performance close to that of standard transformer architectures such as GPT-2 and CRATE.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[When Does Closeness in Distribution Imply Representational Similarity? An Identifiability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03784v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models arbitrarily close to maximizing the likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations, a phenomenon mirrored in our empirical observations on models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results establish a link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.</p></details> |  |
| **[How PARTs assemble into wholes: Learning the relative composition of images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03682v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-BiLM: Knowledge Graph Embedding via Bidirectional Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03576v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects (disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since 2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge, this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset, rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text with 5 figures, 9 pages appendix with 9 figures.

Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains. Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning. We open-source code and pretrained models at: https://github.com/ylzhouchris/MobCLIP.</p></details> |  |

Due to the different sources of human skeletons, skeleton data naturally exhibit heterogeneity. The previous works, however, overlook the heterogeneity of human skeletons and solely construct models tailored for homogeneous skeletons. This work addresses the challenge of heterogeneous skeleton-based action representation learning, specifically focusing on processing skeleton data that varies in joint dimensions and topological structures. The proposed framework comprises two primary components: heterogeneous skeleton processing and unified representation learning. The former first converts two-dimensional skeleton data into three-dimensional skeleton via an auxiliary network, and then constructs a prompted unified skeleton using skeleton-specific prompts. We also design an additional modality named semantic motion encoding to harness the semantic information within skeletons. The latter module learns a unified action representation using a shared backbone network that processes different heterogeneous skeletons. Extensive experiments on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various tasks of action understanding. Our approach can be applied to action recognition in robots with different humanoid structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures.

However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data is open source.

This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback.

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems.

We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory data under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture, Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.

However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> |  |

While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

However, generating emotionally expressive and abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g., Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line, light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally aligned images from text.

Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally, this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants, healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entity Image and Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02291v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The datasets are accessible through the GitHub page: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit-retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges and future directions to guide research in this evolving field.

| **[Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17823v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 Pa...</summary><p>21 Pages, 9 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Incomplete Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01490v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment through multimodal data. In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections. However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

| **[TIME: TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine for Robust Tabular-Image Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00813v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

These constraints have historically impeded the adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics. MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets.

This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixpert: Mitigating Multimodal Learning Conflicts with Efficient Mixture-of-Vision-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24541v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require a nuanced interpretation of complex image information, typically leveraging a vision encoder to perceive various visual scenarios. However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts. Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM, with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across various tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards disentangling the contributions of articulation and acoustics in multimodal phoneme recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24059v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models' attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for certain phonemes.</p></details> |  |

To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The dataset, source code, and trained models were released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional predictive coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Modeling and Optimization of Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23040v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformer (ViT), demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification. However, those deep models require large data to fine-tune, which is impractical in the medical domain due to the data privacy issue. Furthermore, despite the feasible performance of contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) in the natural domain, the potential of CLIP has not been fully investigated in the medical field. To face these challenges, we considered three scenarios: 1) we introduce a novel CLIP variant using four CNNs and eight ViTs as image encoders for the classification of brain cancer and skin cancer, 2) we combine 12 deep models with two federated learning techniques to protect data privacy, and 3) we involve traditional machine learning (ML) methods to improve the generalization ability of those deep models in unseen domain data. The experimental results indicate that maxvit shows the highest averaged (AVG) test metrics (AVG = 87.03\%) in HAM10000 dataset with multimodal learning, while convnext\_l demonstrates remarkable test with an F1-score of 83.98\% compared to swin\_b with 81.33\% in FL model. Furthermore, the use of support vector machine (SVM) can improve the overall test metrics with AVG of $\sim 2\%$ for swin transformer series in ISIC2018.

Transcriptomics provides interpretable, gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene expression representations with morphological information. To address data scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal representations for complex biological tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Proceedings</p></details> |

Recent multimodal learning methods, based on the multimodal information bottleneck (MIB) principle, aim to generate optimal MIB with maximal task-relevant information and minimal superfluous information via regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound. OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency. Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark methods in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiplicity is an Inevitable and Inherent Challenge in Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19614v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon, named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity, and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion and resistance to missing modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality Equilibrium Matters: Minor-Modality-Aware Adaptive Alternating for Cross-Modal Memory Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00030v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion is susceptible to modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weak ones, easily leading to biased learning and suboptimal fusion, especially for incomplete modality conditions. To address this problem, we propose a Shapley-guided alternating training framework that adaptively prioritizes minor modalities to balance and thus enhance the fusion. Our method leverages Shapley Value-based scheduling to improve the training sequence adaptively, ensuring that under-optimized modalities receive sufficient learning. Additionally, we introduce the memory module to refine and inherit modality-specific representations with a cross-modal mapping mechanism to align features at both the feature and sample levels. To further validate the adaptability of the proposed approach, the encoder module empirically adopts both conventional and LLM-based backbones. With building up a novel multimodal equilibrium metric, namely, equilibrium deviation metric (EDM), we evaluate the performance in both balance and accuracy across four multimodal benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Meanwhile, robustness analysis under missing modalities highlights its strong generalization capabilities. Accordingly, our findings reveal the untapped potential of alternating training, demonstrating that strategic modality prioritization fundamentally balances and promotes multimodal learning, offering a new paradigm for optimizing multimodal training dynamics.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, vanilla fusion methods are limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level. First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way. Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios.

However, most current methods rely on proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks: description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility, structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein design.</p></details> |  |

However, modalities collected and curated during development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.</p></details> |  |

As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for robust, calibrated multimodal inference.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Most current methods stack spatial and temporal features in a straightforward way, which adds redundancy and still misses subtle joint-level cues. We introduce HiSTF Mamba, a framework with three parts: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba and a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). The Dual-Spatial module runs part-based and whole-body models in parallel, capturing both overall coordination and fine-grained joint motion. The Bi-Temporal module scans sequences forward and backward to encode short-term details and long-term dependencies. DSFM removes redundant temporal information, extracts complementary cues and fuses them with spatial features to build a richer spatiotemporal representation. Experiments on the HumanML3D benchmark show that HiSTF Mamba performs well across several metrics, achieving high fidelity and tight semantic alignment between text and motion.</p></details> | 15pages,5figures, |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.</p></details> |  |

However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |

Although recent advances have improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering (JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts. Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers. We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figure |

In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches assume the availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.</p></details> |  |

In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters.

We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets.

Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines. The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The datasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are available at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/NSF-MAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, IJCAI 2025 (International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence) Special Track on AI4Tech: AI Enabling Critical Technologies</p></details> |

We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, and 19 references</p></details> |
| **[The Moon's Many Faces: A Single Unified Transformer for Multimodal Lunar Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05644v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 14pages |

Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Model for Focal Liver Lesion Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03350v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of focal liver lesions is crucial for diagnosis and treatment in hepatology. However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Further analysis shows that using a lightweight ResNet18 backbone enhances classification performance, particularly under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures, 4 tables,Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare Proceedings of 13th KES-InMed 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Aggregation of Dependent Expert Distributions in Multimodal Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01134v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Grounding for Efficient Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

| **[A multi-scale vision transformer-based multimodal GeoAI model for mapping Arctic permafrost thaw](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17822v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAP: Isolating Content from Style through Contrastive Learning with Augmented Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16445v6)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have garnered considerable attention for various downstream tasks, mainly due to the remarkable ability of the learned features for generalization. However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |
| **[IoT-AMLHP: Aligned Multimodal Learning of Header-Payload Representations for Resource-Efficient Malicious IoT Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14833v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification is crucial for securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEFT A2Z: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Survey for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14117v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.</p></details> | PEFT Survey paper |

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

| **[A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12796v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MMCLIP: Cross-modal Attention Masked Modelling for Medical Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19546v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Concept Modality Specific Datasets (CMSDs), which consist of data subsets categorized by the modality (visual, textual, or audio) of annotated concepts. Models trained on CMSDs outperform those using traditional legacy training in both early and late fusion approaches. Notably, this approach enables late fusion models to achieve performance close to that of early fusion models. These findings underscore the importance of modality-specific annotations in developing robust, self-explainable video models and contribute to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in complex video analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 Figures |

Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization.

| **[Vision-Language Model for Object Detection and Segmentation: A Review and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09480v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Model (VLM) have gained widespread adoption in Open-Vocabulary (OV) object detection and segmentation tasks. Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research. A project associated with this review and evaluation has been created at https://github.com/better-chao/perceptual_abilities_evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Rev...</summary><p>A Review and Evaluation about Vision-Language Model for Object Detection and Segmentation</p></details> |
| **[Zeus: Zero-shot LLM Instruction for Union Segmentation in Multimodal Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07336v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation has achieved remarkable success through the continuous advancement of UNet-based and Transformer-based foundation backbones. However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> |
| **[FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> |
| **[FluentLip: A Phonemes-Based Two-stage Approach for Audio-Driven Lip Synthesis with Optical Flow Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04427v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional end-to-end or reinforcement learning approaches, our method processes image sequences with pre-trained models and robot state data with machine learning algorithms, fusing their outputs to predict continuous action values for control. Evaluated on BridgeData V2 and Kuka datasets, the best configuration (VGG16 + Random Forest) achieved MSEs of 0.0021 and 0.0028, respectively, demonstrating strong predictive performance and robustness. The framework supports modularity, interpretability, and real-time decision-making, aligning with the goals of adaptive, human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems.</p></details> | 7 pages , 4 figures |
| **[Unimodal-driven Distillation in Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Dynamic Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23721v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) identifies emotional states across text, audio and video, which is essential for intelligent dialogue systems and opinion analysis. Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing minority and semantically similar emotions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |
| **[RGB-Th-Bench: A Dense benchmark for Visual-Thermal Understanding of Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19654v3)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[VGAT: A Cancer Survival Analysis Framework Transitioning from Generative Visual Question Answering to Genomic Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19367v2)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning combining pathology images and genomic sequences enhances cancer survival analysis but faces clinical implementation barriers due to limited access to genomic sequencing in under-resourced regions. To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |
