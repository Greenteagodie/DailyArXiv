| **[Heterogeneous Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01332v1)** | 2020-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making them infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle dynamic heterogeneous graphs, we introduce the relative temporal encoding technique into HGT, which is able to capture the dynamic structural dependency with arbitrary durations. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm---HGSampling---for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9%--21% on various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on WWW 2020</p></details> |
| **[HiGPT: Heterogeneous Graph Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16024v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph learning aims to capture complex relationships and diverse relational semantics among entities in a heterogeneous graph to obtain meaningful representations for nodes and edges. Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules. However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets. Most of these frameworks follow the "pre-train" and "fine-tune" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data. This raises the question: "Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?'' To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm. Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets. To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation. We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions. Through comprehensive evaluations, our proposed framework demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Tree Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00610v1)** | 2022-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have attracted increasing research interest in recent three years. Most existing HGNNs fall into two classes. One class is meta-path-based HGNNs which either require domain knowledge to handcraft meta-paths or consume huge amount of time and memory to automatically construct meta-paths. The other class does not rely on meta-path construction. It takes homogeneous convolutional graph neural networks (Conv-GNNs) as backbones and extend them to heterogeneous graphs by introducing node-type- and edge-type-dependent parameters. Regardless of the meta-path dependency, most existing HGNNs employ shallow Conv-GNNs such as GCN and GAT to aggregate neighborhood information, and may have limited capability to capture information from high-order neighborhood. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous graph tree network models: Heterogeneous Graph Tree Convolutional Network (HetGTCN) and Heterogeneous Graph Tree Attention Network (HetGTAN), which do not rely on meta-paths to encode heterogeneity in both node features and graph structure. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph data demonstrate that the proposed HetGTCN and HetGTAN are efficient and consistently outperform all state-of-the-art HGNN baselines on semi-supervised node classification tasks, and can go deep without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09456v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most previous heterogeneous graph embedding models represent elements in a heterogeneous graph as vector representations in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. However, because heterogeneous graphs inherently possess complex structures, such as hierarchical or power-law structures, distortions can occur when representing them in Euclidean space. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HHGAT) that learn vector representations in hyperbolic spaces with meta-path instances. We conducted experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets, demonstrating that HHGAT outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding models in node classification and clustering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM THE WEB CONFERENCE 2024 short paper track</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Deep Graph Infomax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08538v5)** | 2020-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning is to learn universal node representations that preserve both node attributes and structural information. The derived node representations can be used to serve various downstream tasks, such as node classification and node clustering. When a graph is heterogeneous, the problem becomes more challenging than the homogeneous graph node learning problem. Inspired by the emerging information theoretic-based learning algorithm, in this paper we propose an unsupervised graph neural network Heterogeneous Deep Graph Infomax (HDGI) for heterogeneous graph representation learning. We use the meta-path structure to analyze the connections involving semantics in heterogeneous graphs and utilize graph convolution module and semantic-level attention mechanism to capture local representations. By maximizing local-global mutual information, HDGI effectively learns high-level node representations that can be utilized in downstream graph-related tasks. Experiment results show that HDGI remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised graph representation learning methods on both classification and clustering tasks. By feeding the learned representations into a parametric model, such as logistic regression, we even achieve comparable performance in node classification tasks when comparing with state-of-the-art supervised end-to-end GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffGraph: Heterogeneous Graph Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02313v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized graph-structured data modeling, yet traditional GNNs struggle with complex heterogeneous structures prevalent in real-world scenarios. Despite progress in handling heterogeneous interactions, two fundamental challenges persist: noisy data significantly compromising embedding quality and learning performance, and existing methods' inability to capture intricate semantic transitions among heterogeneous relations, which impacts downstream predictions. To address these fundamental issues, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Diffusion Model (DiffGraph), a pioneering framework that introduces an innovative cross-view denoising strategy. This advanced approach transforms auxiliary heterogeneous data into target semantic spaces, enabling precise distillation of task-relevant information. At its core, DiffGraph features a sophisticated latent heterogeneous graph diffusion mechanism, implementing a novel forward and backward diffusion process for superior noise management. This methodology achieves simultaneous heterogeneous graph denoising and cross-type transition, while significantly simplifying graph generation through its latent-space diffusion capabilities. Through rigorous experimental validation on both public and industrial datasets, we demonstrate that DiffGraph consistently surpasses existing methods in link prediction and node classification tasks, establishing new benchmarks for robustness and efficiency in heterogeneous graph processing. The model implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/DiffGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WSDM'2025</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06807v2)** | 2020-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have gained increasing attention. Existing work in this literature usually models the user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, where users and items are two isolated node sets and edges between them indicate their interactions. Then, the unobserved preference of users can be exploited by modeling high-order connectivity on the bipartite graph. In this work, we propose to model user-item interactions as a heterogeneous graph which consists of not only user-item edges indicating their interaction but also user-user edges indicating their similarity. We develop heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering (HGCF), a GCN-based framework which can explicitly capture both the interaction signal and similarity signal through embedding propagation on the heterogeneous graph. Since the heterogeneous graph is more connected than the bipartite graph, the sparsity issue can be alleviated and the demand for expensive high-order connectivity modeling can be lowered. Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-arts. Further analysis verifies the importance of user-user edges in the graph, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of HGCF.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeGMN: Heterogeneous Graph Matching Network for Learning Graph Similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08739v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph similarity learning (GSL), also referred to as graph matching in many scenarios, is a fundamental problem in computer vision, pattern recognition, and graph learning. However, previous GSL methods assume that graphs are homogeneous and struggle to maintain their performance on heterogeneous graphs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Matching Network (HeGMN), which is an end-to-end graph similarity learning framework composed of a two-tier matching mechanism. Firstly, a heterogeneous graph isomorphism network is proposed as the encoder, which reinvents graph isomorphism network for heterogeneous graphs by perceiving different semantic relationships during aggregation. Secondly, a graph-level and node-level matching modules are designed, both employing type-aligned matching principles. The former conducts graph-level matching by node type alignment, and the latter computes the interactions between the cross-graph nodes with the same type thus reducing noise interference and computational overhead. Finally, the graph-level and node-level matching features are combined and fed into fully connected layers for predicting graph similarity scores. In experiments, we propose a heterogeneous graph resampling method to construct heterogeneous graph pairs and define the corresponding heterogeneous graph edit distance, filling the gap in missing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HeGMN consistently achieves advanced performance on graph similarity prediction across all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07293v2)** | 2021-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Spectral Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00708v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs can well describe the complex entity relationships in the real world. For example, online shopping networks contain multiple physical types of consumers and products, as well as multiple relationship types such as purchasing and favoriting. More and more scholars pay attention to this research because heterogeneous graph representation learning shows strong application potential in real-world scenarios. However, the existing heterogeneous graph models use data augmentation techniques to enhance the use of graph structure information, which only captures the graph structure information from the spatial topology, ignoring the information displayed in the spectrum dimension of the graph structure. To address the issue that heterogeneous graph representation learning methods fail to model spectral information, this paper introduces a spectral-enhanced graph contrastive learning model (SHCL) and proposes a spectral augmentation algorithm for the first time in heterogeneous graph neural networks. The proposed model learns an adaptive topology augmentation scheme through the heterogeneous graph itself, disrupting the structural information of the heterogeneous graph in the spectrum dimension, and ultimately improving the learning effect of the model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate substantial advantages of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09957v2)** | 2023-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative self-supervised learning (SSL), especially masked autoencoders, has become one of the most exciting learning paradigms and has shown great potential in handling graph data. However, real-world graphs are always heterogeneous, which poses three critical challenges that existing methods ignore: 1) how to capture complex graph structure? 2) how to incorporate various node attributes? and 3) how to encode different node positions? In light of this, we study the problem of generative SSL on heterogeneous graphs and propose HGMAE, a novel heterogeneous graph masked autoencoder model to address these challenges. HGMAE captures comprehensive graph information via two innovative masking techniques and three unique training strategies. In particular, we first develop metapath masking and adaptive attribute masking with dynamic mask rate to enable effective and stable learning on heterogeneous graphs. We then design several training strategies including metapath-based edge reconstruction to adopt complex structural information, target attribute restoration to incorporate various node attributes, and positional feature prediction to encode node positional information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGMAE outperforms both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks across multiple datasets.

| **[Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13889v1)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been broadly studied on dynamic graphs for their representation learning, majority of which focus on graphs with homogeneous structures in the spatial domain. However, many real-world graphs - i.e., heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) - evolve dynamically in the context of heterogeneous graph structures. The dynamics associated with heterogeneity have posed new challenges for HTG representation learning. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose heterogeneous temporal graph neural network (HTGNN) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving the heterogeneity to learn node representations over HTGs. Specifically, in each layer of HTGNN, we propose a hierarchical aggregation mechanism, including intra-relation, inter-relation, and across-time aggregations, to jointly model heterogeneous spatial dependencies and temporal dimensions. To retain the heterogeneity, intra-relation aggregation is first performed over each slice of HTG to attentively aggregate information of neighbors with the same type of relation, and then intra-relation aggregation is exploited to gather information over different types of relations; to handle temporal dependencies, across-time aggregation is conducted to exchange information across different graph slices over the HTG. The proposed HTGNN is a holistic framework tailored heterogeneity with evolution in time and space for HTG representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on the HTGs built from different real-world datasets and promising results demonstrate the outstanding performance of HTGNN by comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. Our built HTGs and code have been made publicly accessible at: https://github.com/YesLab-Code/HTGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Hyperbolic Space-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11283v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To leverage the complex structures within heterogeneous graphs, recent studies on heterogeneous graph embedding use a hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and exponentially increasing space, which aligns with the structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. However, despite heterogeneous graphs inherently possessing diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models use a single hyperbolic space for the entire heterogeneous graph, which may not effectively capture the diverse power-law structures within the heterogeneous graph. To address this limitation, we propose Multi-hyperbolic Space-based heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (MSGAT), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to effectively capture diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MSGAT. The experimental results demonstrate that MSGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graphlet and Orbit Computation on Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14268v3)** | 2023-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications, ranging from natural to social sciences, rely on graphlet analysis for the intuitive and meaningful characterization of networks employing micro-level structures as building blocks. However, it has not been thoroughly explored in heterogeneous graphs, which comprise various types of nodes and edges. Finding graphlets and orbits for heterogeneous graphs is difficult because of the heterogeneity and abundance of semantic information. We consider heterogeneous graphs, which can be treated as colored graphs. By applying the canonical label technique, we determine the graph isomorphism problem with multiple states on nodes and edges. With minimal parameters, we build all non-isomorphic graphs and associated orbits. We provide a Python package that can be used to generate orbits for colored directed graphs and determine the frequency of orbit occurrence. Finally, we provide four examples to illustrate the use of the Python package.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00995v1)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools in modeling graph-structured data in recommender systems. However, real-life recommendation scenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user influence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information to enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation. In light of this, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge transfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side information on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea forward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta networks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive contrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to benefit the recommendation performance improvement. The source code of the model implementation is available at the link https://github.com/HKUDS/HGCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published as a full paper at WSDM 2023</p></details> |
| **[R-GSN: The Relation-based Graph Similar Network for Heterogeneous Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07877v3)** | 2021-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph is a kind of data structure widely existing in real life. Nowadays, the research of graph neural network on heterogeneous graph has become more and more popular. The existing heterogeneous graph neural network algorithms mainly have two ideas, one is based on meta-path and the other is not. The idea based on meta-path often requires a lot of manual preprocessing, at the same time it is difficult to extend to large scale graphs. In this paper, we proposed the general heterogeneous message passing paradigm and designed R-GSN that does not need meta-path, which is much improved compared to the baseline R-GCN. Experiments have shown that our R-GSN algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ogbn-mag large scale heterogeneous graph dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeteroMILE: a Multi-Level Graph Representation Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00816v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications because they can represent various relationships between different types of entities. Therefore, learning embeddings in such graphs is a critical problem in graph machine learning. However, existing solutions for this problem fail to scale to large heterogeneous graphs due to their high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Level Embedding framework of nodes on a heterogeneous graph (HeteroMILE) - a generic methodology that allows contemporary graph embedding methods to scale to large graphs. HeteroMILE repeatedly coarsens the large sized graph into a smaller size while preserving the backbone structure of the graph before embedding it, effectively reducing the computational cost by avoiding time-consuming processing operations. It then refines the coarsened embedding to the original graph using a heterogeneous graph convolution neural network. We evaluate our approach using several popular heterogeneous graph datasets. The experimental results show that HeteroMILE can substantially reduce computational time (approximately 20x speedup) and generate an embedding of better quality for link prediction and node classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00644v1)** | 2021-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional network (GCN) based approaches have achieved significant progress for solving complex, graph-structured problems. GCNs incorporate the graph structure information and the node (or edge) features through message passing and computes 'deep' node representations. Despite significant progress in the field, designing GCN architectures for heterogeneous graphs still remains an open challenge. Due to the schema of a heterogeneous graph, useful information may reside multiple hops away. A key question is how to perform message passing to incorporate information of neighbors multiple hops away while avoiding the well-known over-smoothing problem in GCNs. To address this question, we propose our GCN framework 'Deep Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (DHGCN)', which takes advantage of the schema of a heterogeneous graph and uses a hierarchical approach to effectively utilize information many hops away. It first computes representations of the target nodes based on their 'schema-derived ego-network' (SEN). It then links the nodes of the same type with various pre-defined metapaths and performs message passing along these links to compute final node representations. Our design choices naturally capture the way a heterogeneous graph is generated from the schema. The experimental results on real and synthetic datasets corroborate the design choice and illustrate the performance gains relative to competing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSim: A Graph Neural Network based Relevance Measure for Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06144v2)** | 2023-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs, which contain nodes and edges of multiple types, are prevalent in various domains, including bibliographic networks, social media, and knowledge graphs. As a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs, relevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of different types, which has been used in many applications such as web search, recommendation, and community detection. Most of existing relevance measures focus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few measures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the pre-defined meta-path. Defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. Recently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been applied for measuring relevance yet. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel GNN-based relevance measure, namely GSim. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze and show that GNN is effective for measuring the relevance of nodes in the graph. We then propose a context path-based graph neural network (CP-GNN) to automatically leverage the semantics in heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, we exploit CP-GNN to support relevance measures between two objects of any type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSim outperforms existing measures.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |
| **[Graph Attention for Heterogeneous Graphs with Positional Encoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02938v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for modeling graph data, with attention mechanisms and transformers significantly enhancing their performance on graph-based tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11898v1)** | 2021-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation based on social network has achieved great success in improving the performance of recommendation system. Since social network (user-user relations) and user-item interactions are both naturally represented as graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have thus been widely applied for social recommendation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous global graph learning framework, namely Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GL-HGNN) for social recommendation. GL-HGNN aims to learn a heterogeneous global graph that makes full use of user-user relations, user-item interactions and item-item similarities in a unified perspective. To this end, we design a Graph Learner (GL) method to learn and optimize user-user and item-item connections separately. Moreover, we employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to capture the high-order complex semantic relations from our learned heterogeneous global graph. To scale up the computation of graph learning, we further present the Anchor-based Graph Learner (AGL) to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

While there are many benchmark datasets for homogeneous graphs, only a few of them are available for heterogeneous graphs. Furthermore, the latter graphs are small in size rendering them insufficient to understand how graph learning algorithms perform in terms of classification metrics and computational resource utilization. We introduce, PDNS-Net, the largest public heterogeneous graph dataset containing 447K nodes and 897K edges for the malicious domain classification task. Compared to the popular heterogeneous datasets IMDB and DBLP, PDNS-Net is 38 and 17 times bigger respectively. We provide a detailed analysis of PDNS-Net including the data collection methodology, heterogeneous graph construction, descriptive statistics and preliminary graph classification performance. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/qcri/PDNS-Net. Our preliminary evaluation of both popular homogeneous and heterogeneous graph neural networks on PDNS-Net reveals that further research is required to improve the performance of these models on large heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Graph Learning Benchmark 2022</p></details> |
| **[SHGNN: Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06244v2)** | 2021-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world graphs (networks) are heterogeneous with different types of nodes and edges. Heterogeneous graph embedding, aiming at learning the low-dimensional node representations of a heterogeneous graph, is vital for various downstream applications. Many meta-path based embedding methods have been proposed to learn the semantic information of heterogeneous graphs in recent years. However, most of the existing techniques overlook the graph structure information when learning the heterogeneous graph embeddings. This paper proposes a novel Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SHGNN) to address the above limitations. In detail, we first utilize a feature propagation module to capture the local structure information of intermediate nodes in the meta-path. Next, we use a tree-attention aggregator to incorporate the graph structure information into the aggregation module on the meta-path. Finally, we leverage a meta-path aggregator to fuse the information aggregated from different meta-paths. We conducted experiments on node classification and clustering tasks and achieved state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry Contrastive Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12547v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) methods on heterogeneous graphs can effectively get rid of the dependence on supervisory data. Meanwhile, most existing representation learning methods embed the heterogeneous graphs into a single geometric space, either Euclidean or hyperbolic. This kind of single geometric view is usually not enough to observe the complete picture of heterogeneous graphs due to their rich semantics and complex structures. Under these observations, this paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method, termed as Geometry Contrastive Learning (GCL), to better represent the heterogeneous graphs when supervisory data is unavailable. GCL views a heterogeneous graph from Euclidean and hyperbolic perspective simultaneously, aiming to make a strong merger of the ability of modeling rich semantics and complex structures, which is expected to bring in more benefits for downstream tasks. GCL maximizes the mutual information between two geometric views by contrasting representations at both local-local and local-global semantic levels. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms the strong baselines, including both unsupervised methods and supervised methods, on three tasks, including node classification, node clustering and similarity search.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Learning on heterogeneous graphs using high-order relations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15532v2)** | 2023-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A heterogeneous graph consists of different vertices and edges types. Learning on heterogeneous graphs typically employs meta-paths to deal with the heterogeneity by reducing the graph to a homogeneous network, guide random walks or capture semantics. These methods are however sensitive to the choice of meta-paths, with suboptimal paths leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning on heterogeneous graphs without using meta-paths. Specifically, we decompose a heterogeneous graph into different homogeneous relation-type graphs, which are then combined to create higher-order relation-type representations. These representations preserve the heterogeneity of edges and retain their edge directions while capturing the interaction of different vertex types multiple hops apart. This is then complemented with attention mechanisms to distinguish the importance of the relation-type based neighbors and the relation-types themselves. Experiments demonstrate that our model generally outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in the vertex classification task on three commonly studied heterogeneous graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically explore simplified models to mitigate resource and time overhead, neglecting the crucial aspect of simplifying large-scale heterogeneous graphs from the data-centric perspective. Addressing this gap, HGCond introduces graph condensation (GC) in heterogeneous graphs and generates a small condensed graph for efficient model training. Despite its efficacy in graph generation, HGCond encounters two significant limitations. The first is low effectiveness, HGCond excessively relies on the simplest relay model for the condensation procedure, which restricts the ability to exert powerful Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with flexible condensation ratio and limits the generalization ability. The second is low efficiency, HGCond follows the existing GC methods designed for homogeneous graphs and leverages the sophisticated optimization paradigm, resulting in a time-consuming condensing procedure. In light of these challenges, we present the first Training \underline{Free} Heterogeneous Graph Condensation method, termed FreeHGC, facilitating both efficient and high-quality generation of heterogeneous condensed graphs. Specifically, we reformulate the heterogeneous graph condensation problem as a data selection issue, offering a new perspective for assessing and condensing representative nodes and edges in the heterogeneous graphs. By leveraging rich meta-paths, we introduce a new, high-quality heterogeneous data selection criterion to select target-type nodes. Furthermore, two training-free condensation strategies for heterogeneous graphs are designed to condense and synthesize other-types nodes effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Micro/Macro Level Convolution for Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14722v1)** | 2021-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are pervasive in practical scenarios, where each graph consists of multiple types of nodes and edges. Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain low-dimensional node representations that could preserve both node attributes and relation information. However, most of the existing graph convolution approaches were designed for homogeneous graphs, and therefore cannot handle heterogeneous graphs. Some recent methods designed for heterogeneous graphs are also faced with several issues, including the insufficient utilization of heterogeneous properties, structural information loss, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose HGConv, a novel Heterogeneous Graph Convolution approach, to learn comprehensive node representations on heterogeneous graphs with a hybrid micro/macro level convolutional operation. Different from existing methods, HGConv could perform convolutions on the intrinsic structure of heterogeneous graphs directly at both micro and macro levels: A micro-level convolution to learn the importance of nodes within the same relation, and a macro-level convolution to distinguish the subtle difference across different relations. The hybrid strategy enables HGConv to fully leverage heterogeneous information with proper interpretability. Moreover, a weighted residual connection is designed to aggregate both inherent attributes and neighbor information of the focal node adaptively. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate not only the superiority of HGConv over existing methods, but also the intuitive interpretability of our approach for graph analysis.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |

However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted tp CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Recently, heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) has shown great potential in learning on HG. Current studies of HGNN mainly focus on some HGs with strong homophily properties (nodes connected by meta-path tend to have the same labels), while few discussions are made in those that are less homophilous. Recently, there have been many works on homogeneous graphs with heterophily. However, due to heterogeneity, it is non-trivial to extend their approach to deal with HGs with heterophily. In this work, based on empirical observations, we propose a meta-path-induced metric to measure the homophily degree of a HG. We also find that current HGNNs may have degenerated performance when handling HGs with less homophilous properties. Thus it is essential to increase the generalization ability of HGNNs on non-homophilous HGs. To this end, we propose HDHGR, a homophily-oriented deep heterogeneous graph rewiring approach that modifies the HG structure to increase the performance of HGNN. We theoretically verify HDHGR. In addition, experiments on real-world HGs demonstrate the effectiveness of HDHGR, which brings at most more than 10% relative gain.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2023 |

However, the most recent node embedding strategies have focused on undirected graphs, with limited attention to directed graphs, especially directed heterogeneous graphs. In this study, we first investigated the network properties of directed heterogeneous graphs. Based on network analysis, we proposed an embedding method, a bidirectional heterogeneous graph neural network with random teleport (BHGNN-RT), for directed heterogeneous graphs, that leverages bidirectional message-passing process and network heterogeneity. With the optimization of teleport proportion, BHGNN-RT is beneficial to overcome the over-smoothing problem. Extensive experiments on various datasets were conducted to verify the efficacy and efficiency of BHGNN-RT. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of message components, model layer, and teleport proportion on model performance. The performance comparison with all other baselines illustrates that BHGNN-RT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the benchmark methods in both node classification and unsupervised clustering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Privacy-Preserving Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00538v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are considered to be heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) with deep learning technological advances. HGNNs, compared to homogeneous data, absorb various aspects of information about individuals in the training stage. That means more information has been covered in the learning result, especially sensitive information. However, the privacy-preserving methods on homogeneous graphs only preserve the same type of node attributes or relationships, which cannot effectively work on heterogeneous graphs due to the complexity. To address this issue, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network privacy-preserving method based on a differential privacy mechanism named HeteDP, which provides a double guarantee on graph features and topology. In particular, we first define a new attack scheme to reveal privacy leakage in the heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we design a two-stage pipeline framework, which includes the privacy-preserving feature encoder and the heterogeneous link reconstructor with gradients perturbation based on differential privacy to tolerate data diversity and against the attack. To better control the noise and promote model performance, we utilize a bi-level optimization pattern to allocate a suitable privacy budget for the above two modules. Our experiments on four public benchmarks show that the HeteDP method is equipped to resist heterogeneous graph privacy leakage with admirable model generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing HGNNs inherit many mechanisms from graph neural networks (GNNs) over homogeneous graphs, especially the attention mechanism and the multi-layer structure. These mechanisms bring excessive complexity, but seldom work studies whether they are really effective on heterogeneous graphs. This paper conducts an in-depth and detailed study of these mechanisms and proposes Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SeHGNN). To easily capture structural information, SeHGNN pre-computes the neighbor aggregation using a light-weight mean aggregator, which reduces complexity by removing overused neighbor attention and avoiding repeated neighbor aggregation in every training epoch. To better utilize semantic information, SeHGNN adopts the single-layer structure with long metapaths to extend the receptive field, as well as a transformer-based semantic fusion module to fuse features from different metapaths. As a result, SeHGNN exhibits the characteristics of simple network structure, high prediction accuracy, and fast training speed. Extensive experiments on five real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority of SeHGNN over the state-of-the-arts on both accuracy and training speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023</p></details> |

To this end, in this paper, we present a new dynamic heterogeneous graph representation for social networks which includes time in every single component of the graph, i.e., nodes and edges, each of different types that captures heterogeneity. We illustrate the power of this representation by presenting four time-dependent queries and deep learning problems that cannot easily be handled in conventional homogeneous graph representations commonly used. As a proof of concept we present a detailed representation of a new social media platform (Steemit), which we use to illustrate both the dynamic querying capability as well as prediction tasks using graph neural networks (GNNs). The results illustrate the power of the dynamic heterogeneous graph representation to model social networks. Given that this is a relatively understudied area we also illustrate opportunities for future work in query optimization as well as new dynamic prediction tasks on heterogeneous graph structures.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks confirm the superiority of CLEAR. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5% improvement on the F1 metric for node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

Heterogeneous graph embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple metapaths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the metapath, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations, we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at WWW 2020; 11 pages, 4 figures; typos of model name corrected</p></details> |

However, on the one hand, most of existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods either insufficiently model the local structure under specific semantic, or neglect the heterogeneity when aggregating information from it. On the other hand, representations from multiple semantics are not comprehensively integrated to obtain versatile node embeddings. To address the problem, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-View Representation Learning (named MV-HetGNN) for heterogeneous graph embedding by introducing the idea of multi-view representation learning. The proposed model consists of node feature transformation, view-specific ego graph encoding and auto multi-view fusion to thoroughly learn complex structural and semantic information for generating comprehensive node representations. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that the proposed MV-HetGNN model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines in various downstream tasks, e.g., node classification, node clustering, and link prediction.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |

However, existing methods ignore a tree hierarchy among metapaths, naturally constituted by different node types and relation types. In this paper, we present HetTree, a novel HGNN that models both the graph structure and heterogeneous aspects in a scalable and effective manner. Specifically, HetTree builds a semantic tree data structure to capture the hierarchy among metapaths. To effectively encode the semantic tree, HetTree uses a novel subtree attention mechanism to emphasize metapaths that are more helpful in encoding parent-child relationships. Moreover, HetTree proposes carefully matching pre-computed features and labels correspondingly, constituting a complete metapath representation. Our evaluation of HetTree on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrates that it outperforms all existing baselines on open benchmarks and efficiently scales to large real-world graphs with millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing works ignore the relation heterogeneity with multiplex network between multi-typed nodes and different importance of relations in meta-paths for node embedding, which can hardly capture the heterogeneous structure signals across different relations. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN) for heterogeneous network embedding. Our MHGCN can automatically learn the useful heterogeneous meta-path interactions of different lengths in multiplex heterogeneous networks through multi-layer convolution aggregation. Additionally, we effectively integrate both multi-relation structural signals and attribute semantics into the learned node embeddings with both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets with various network analytical tasks demonstrate the significant superiority of MHGCN against state-of-the-art embedding baselines in terms of all evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

To address these problems, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Contrastive Learning (RHCO) for large-scale heterogeneous graph representation learning. Unlike traditional heterogeneous graph neural networks, we adopt the contrastive learning mechanism to deal with the complex heterogeneity of large-scale heterogeneous graphs. We first learn relation-aware node embeddings under the network schema view. Then we propose a novel positive sample selection strategy to choose meaningful positive samples. After learning node embeddings under the positive sample graph view, we perform a cross-view contrastive learning to obtain the final node representations. Moreover, we adopt the label smoothing technique to boost the performance of RHCO. Extensive experiments on three large-scale academic heterogeneous graph datasets show that RHCO achieves best performance over the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this problem by (i) proposing a parametric graph construction strategy for the intra-modal edges, and (ii) learning the crossmodal edges. To this end, we develop a new model, heterogeneous graph crossmodal network (HGCN) that learns the crossmodal edges. Our proposed model can adapt to various spatial and temporal scales owing to its parametric construction, while the learnable crossmodal edges effectively connect the relevant nodes across modalities.

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL)-based Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential in utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation remains limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators suffer from sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN). Specifically, we propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning method that enhances CL-based paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy aimed at capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

By learning from EHRs, machine learning models can be built to help human experts to make medical decisions and thus improve healthcare quality. Recently, many models based on sequential or graph models are proposed to achieve this goal. EHRs contain multiple entities and relations and can be viewed as a heterogeneous graph. However, previous studies ignore the heterogeneity in EHRs. On the other hand, current heterogeneous graph neural networks cannot be simply used on an EHR graph because of the existence of hub nodes in it. To address this issue, we propose Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Network (HSGNN) analyze EHRs with a novel heterogeneous GNN. Our framework consists of two parts: one is a preprocessing method and the other is an end-to-end GNN. The preprocessing method normalizes edges and splits the EHR graph into multiple homogeneous graphs while each homogeneous graph contains partial information of the original EHR graph. The GNN takes all homogeneous graphs as input and fuses all of them into one graph to make a prediction. Experimental results show that HSGNN outperforms other baselines in the diagnosis prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Very few studies have been conducted to investigate heterogeneous causal effects (HCEs) in graphical contexts due to the lack of statistical methods. To characterize this heterogeneity, we first conceptualize heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing the causal graphical model with confounder-based interactions and multiple mediators. Such confounders with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators. This allows us to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly characterize HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. We establish the theoretical forms of HCEs and derive their properties at the individual level in both linear and nonlinear models. An interactive structural learning is developed to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals provided. Our method is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its practical usefulness is illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric disorders for trauma survivors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Code implementing the proposed algorithm is open-source and publicly available at: https://github.com/richard-watson/ISL</p></details> |

While current GNNs perform well in node classification tasks within in-distribution (ID) settings, real-world scenarios often present distribution shifts, leading to the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes. OOD detection in graphs is a crucial and challenging task. Most existing research focuses on homogeneous graphs, but real-world graphs are often heterogeneous, consisting of diverse node and edge types. This heterogeneity adds complexity and enriches the informational content. To the best of our knowledge, OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs remains an underexplored area. In this context, we propose a novel methodology for OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs (OODHG) that aims to achieve two main objectives: 1) detecting OOD nodes and 2) classifying all ID nodes based on the first task's results. Specifically, we learn representations for each node in the heterogeneous graph, calculate energy values to determine whether nodes are OOD, and then classify ID nodes. To leverage the structural information of heterogeneous graphs, we introduce a meta-path-based energy propagation mechanism and an energy constraint to enhance the distinction between ID and OOD nodes. Extensive experimental findings substantiate the simplicity and effectiveness of OODHG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models in OOD detection tasks and its accuracy in ID node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Knowl...</summary><p>Knowledge-Based Systems 2025</p></details> |

This parameterization of heterogeneity also recovers several other canonical distributions as intermediate special cases, including the Gaussian, Rayleigh, and exponential distributions.

Existing heterogeneous graph learning methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics. Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the TKDE journal</p></details> |

This heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various downstream tasks.

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

In existing heterogeneous GNNs, meta-path plays an essential role. However, recent work pointed out that simple homogeneous graph model without meta-path can also achieve comparable results, which calls into question the necessity of meta-path. In this paper, we first present the intrinsic difference about meta-path-based and meta-path-free models, i.e., how to select neighbors for node aggregation. Then, we propose a novel framework to utilize the rich type semantic information in heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, namely HAGNN (Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous GNNs). The core of HAGNN is to leverage the meta-path neighbors and the directly connected neighbors simultaneously for node aggregations. HAGNN divides the overall aggregation process into two phases: meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation. During the intra-type aggregation phase, we propose a new data structure called fused meta-path graph and perform structural semantic aware aggregation on it. Finally, we combine the embeddings generated by each phase. Compared with existing heterogeneous GNN models, HAGNN can take full advantage of the heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experimental results on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks show that HAGNN outperforms the existing modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[Cross-heterogeneity Graph Few-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05275v1)** | 2023-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[HHGT: Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13158v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Represent Programs with Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04188v3)** | 2022-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program source code contains complex structure information, which can be represented in structured data forms like trees or graphs. To acquire the structural information in source code, most existing researches use abstract syntax trees (AST). A group of works add additional edges to ASTs to convert source code into graphs and use graph neural networks to learn representations for program graphs. Although these works provide additional control or data flow information to ASTs for downstream tasks, they neglect an important aspect of structure information in AST itself: the different types of nodes and edges. In ASTs, different nodes contain different kinds of information like variables or control flow, and the relation between a node and all its children can also be different. To address the information of node and edge types, we bring the idea of heterogeneous graphs to learning on source code and present a new formula of building heterogeneous program graphs from ASTs with additional type information for nodes and edges. We use the ASDL grammar of programming language to define the node and edge types of program graphs. Then we use heterogeneous graph neural networks to learn on these graphs. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: code comment generation and method naming. Both tasks require reasoning on the semantics of complete code snippets. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms baseline models, including homogeneous graph-based models, showing that leveraging the type information of nodes and edges in program graphs can help in learning program semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICPC 2022</p></details> |
| **[Metapaths guided Neighbors aggregated Network for?Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06474v1)** | 2021-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most real-world datasets are inherently heterogeneous graphs, which involve a diversity of node and relation types. Heterogeneous graph embedding is to learn the structure and semantic information from the graph, and then embed it into the low-dimensional node representation. Existing methods usually capture the composite relation of a heterogeneous graph by defining metapath, which represent a semantic of the graph. However, these methods either ignore node attributes, or discard the local and global information of the graph, or only consider one metapath. To address these limitations, we propose a Metapaths-guided Neighbors-aggregated Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network(MHN) to improve performance. Specially, MHN employs node base embedding to encapsulate node attributes, BFS and DFS neighbors aggregation within a metapath to capture local and global information, and metapaths aggregation to combine different semantics of the heterogeneous graph. We conduct extensive experiments for the proposed MHN on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets, including node classification, link prediction and online A/B test on Alibaba mobile application. Results demonstrate that MHN performs better than other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniting Heterogeneity, Inductiveness, and Efficiency for Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01711v2)** | 2021-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ubiquitous graph-structured data in various applications, models that can learn compact but expressive vector representations of nodes have become highly desirable. Recently, bearing the message passing paradigm, graph neural networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the performance of node representation learning on graphs. However, a majority class of GNNs are only designed for homogeneous graphs, leading to inferior adaptivity to the more informative heterogeneous graphs with various types of nodes and edges. Also, despite the necessity of inductively producing representations for completely new nodes (e.g., in streaming scenarios), few heterogeneous GNNs can bypass the transductive learning scheme where all nodes must be known during training. Furthermore, the training efficiency of most heterogeneous GNNs has been hindered by their sophisticated designs for extracting the semantics associated with each meta path or relation. In this paper, we propose WIde and DEep message passing Network (WIDEN) to cope with the aforementioned problems about heterogeneity, inductiveness, and efficiency that are rarely investigated together in graph representation learning. In WIDEN, we propose a novel inductive, meta path-free message passing scheme that packs up heterogeneous node features with their associated edges from both low- and high-order neighbor nodes. To further improve the training efficiency, we innovatively present an active downsampling strategy that drops unimportant neighbor nodes to facilitate faster information propagation. Experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs have further validated the efficacy of WIDEN on both transductive and inductive node representation learning, as well as the superior training efficiency against state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript is under review</p></details> |

With larger parameter spaces, HGNNs may require more training data, which is often scarce in real-world applications due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to train a GNN collaboratively without sharing their local data. However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. FedHGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to $\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable $\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a $\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening. Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic, heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic integrity of the original graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction on Latent Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10432v1)** | 2023-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On graph data, the multitude of node or edge types gives rise to heterogeneous information networks (HINs). To preserve the heterogeneous semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent heterogeneous semantics as the node/edge types cannot be observed. In this paper, we study the challenging and unexplored problem of link prediction on an LHG. As existing approaches depend heavily on type-based information, they are suboptimal or even inapplicable on LHGs. To address the absence of type information, we propose a model named LHGNN, based on the novel idea of semantic embedding at node and path levels, to capture latent semantics on and between nodes. We further design a personalization function to modulate the heterogeneous contexts conditioned on their latent semantics w.r.t. the target node, to enable finer-grained aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of LHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TheWebConf 2023</p></details> |

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is in proceedings of the 34th IJCAI Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph-Based Multimodal Brain Network Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08465v5)** | 2022-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide powerful insights for brain neuroimaging technology from the view of graphical networks. However, most existing GNN-based models assume that the neuroimaging-produced brain connectome network is a homogeneous graph with single types of nodes and edges. In fact, emerging studies have reported and emphasized the significance of heterogeneity among human brain activities, especially between the two cerebral hemispheres. Thus, homogeneous-structured brain network-based graph methods are insufficient for modelling complicated cerebral activity states. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we present a heterogeneous graph neural network (HebrainGNN) for multimodal brain neuroimaging fusion learning. We first model the brain network as a heterogeneous graph with multitype nodes (i.e., left and right hemispheric nodes) and multitype edges (i.e., intra- and interhemispheric edges). Then, we propose a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on a heterogeneous brain network to address the potential overfitting problem caused by the conflict between a large parameter size and a small medical data sample size. Our results show the superiority of the proposed model over other existing methods in brain-related disease prediction tasks. Ablation experiments show that our heterogeneous graph-based model attaches more importance to hemispheric connections that may be neglected due to their low strength by previous homogeneous graph models. Other experiments also indicate that our proposed model with a pretraining strategy alleviates the problem of limited labelled data and yields a significant improvement in accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous manifolds for curvature-aware graph embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01185v1)** | 2022-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph embeddings, wherein the nodes of the graph are represented by points in a continuous space, are used in a broad range of Graph ML applications. The quality of such embeddings crucially depends on whether the geometry of the space matches that of the graph. Euclidean spaces are often a poor choice for many types of real-world graphs, where hierarchical structure and a power-law degree distribution are linked to negative curvature. In this regard, it has recently been shown that hyperbolic spaces and more general manifolds, such as products of constant-curvature spaces and matrix manifolds, are advantageous to approximately match nodes pairwise distances. However, all these classes of manifolds are homogeneous, implying that the curvature distribution is the same at each point, making them unsuited to match the local curvature (and related structural properties) of the graph. In this paper, we study graph embeddings in a broader class of heterogeneous rotationally-symmetric manifolds. By adding a single extra radial dimension to any given existing homogeneous model, we can both account for heterogeneous curvature distributions on graphs and pairwise distances. We evaluate our approach on reconstruction tasks on synthetic and real datasets and show its potential in better preservation of high-order structures and heterogeneous random graphs generation.</p></details> |  |

Many existing HGNNs design a variety of tailor-made graph convolutions to capture structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. However, existing HGNNs usually represent each node as a single vector in the multi-layer graph convolution calculation, which makes the high-level graph convolution layer fail to distinguish information from different relations and different orders, resulting in the information loss in the message passing. %insufficient mining of information. To this end, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network with sequential node representation, namely Seq-HGNN. To avoid the information loss caused by the single vector node representation, we first design a sequential node representation learning mechanism to represent each node as a sequence of meta-path representations during the node message passing. Then we propose a heterogeneous representation fusion module, empowering Seq-HGNN to identify important meta-paths and aggregate their representations into a compact one. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets from Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

While significant advancements have been made in learning the structure of homogeneous graphs, many real-world graphs exhibit heterogeneous patterns where nodes and edges have multiple types. This paper fills this gap by introducing the first approach for heterogeneous graph structure learning (HGSL). To this end, we first propose a novel statistical model for the data-generating process (DGP) of heterogeneous graph data, namely hidden Markov networks for heterogeneous graphs (H2MN). Then we formalize HGSL as a maximum a-posterior estimation problem parameterized by such DGP and derive an alternating optimization method to obtain a solution together with a theoretical justification of the optimization conditions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method excels in learning structure on heterogeneous graphs in terms of edge type identification and edge weight recovery.</p></details> |  |

However, the irregular memory access pattern of HGNNs leads to the buffer thrashing issue in HGNN accelerators. In this work, we identify an opportunity to address buffer thrashing in HGNN acceleration through an analysis of the topology of heterogeneous graphs. To harvest this opportunity, we propose a graph restructuring method and map it into a hardware frontend named GDR-HGNN. GDR-HGNN dynamically restructures the graph on the fly to enhance data locality for HGNN accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the assistance of GDR-HGNN, a leading HGNN accelerator achieves an average speedup of 14.6 times and 1.78 times compared to the state-of-the-art software framework running on A100 GPU and itself, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, accepted by DAC'61</p></details> |

In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[Higher-order Spectral Clustering for Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02959v1)** | 2020-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order connectivity patterns such as small induced sub-graphs called graphlets (network motifs) are vital to understand the important components (modules/functional units) governing the configuration and behavior of complex networks. Existing work in higher-order clustering has focused on simple homogeneous graphs with a single node/edge type. However, heterogeneous graphs consisting of nodes and edges of different types are seemingly ubiquitous in the real-world. In this work, we introduce the notion of typed-graphlet that explicitly captures the rich (typed) connectivity patterns in heterogeneous networks. Using typed-graphlets as a basis, we develop a general principled framework for higher-order clustering in heterogeneous networks. The framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of the higher-order clustering obtained. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework quantitatively for three important applications including (i) clustering, (ii) link prediction, and (iii) graph compression. In particular, the approach achieves a mean improvement of 43x over all methods and graphs for clustering while achieving a 18.7% and 20.8% improvement for link prediction and graph compression, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16754v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Most existing methods for heterogeneous graphs mainly learn node embeddings by stacking multiple convolutional or attentional layers, which can be considered as capturing the high-order information from node-level aspect. However, different types of nodes in heterogeneous graphs have diverse features, it is also necessary to capture interactions among node features, namely the high-order information from feature-level aspect. In addition, most methods first align node features by mapping them into one same low-dimensional space, while they may lose some type information of nodes in this way. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph Cascade Attention Network (HetCAN) composed of multiple cascade blocks. Each cascade block includes two components, the type-aware encoder and the dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and aims to make full use of graph heterogeneity. The dimension-aware encoder is able to learn the feature-level high-order information by capturing the interactions among node features. With the assistance of these components, HetCAN can comprehensively encode information of node features, graph heterogeneity and graph structure in node embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HetCAN over advanced competitors and also exhibit its efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Weighted Heterogeneous Graph Based Dialogue System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10699v2)** | 2020-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge based dialogue systems have attracted increasing research interest in diverse applications. However, for disease diagnosis, the widely used knowledge graph is hard to represent the symptom-symptom relations and symptom-disease relations since the edges of traditional knowledge graph are unweighted. Most research on disease diagnosis dialogue systems highly rely on data-driven methods and statistical features, lacking profound comprehension of symptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations. To tackle this issue, this work presents a weighted heterogeneous graph based dialogue system for disease diagnosis. Specifically, we build a weighted heterogeneous graph based on symptom co-occurrence and a proposed symptom frequency-inverse disease frequency. Then this work proposes a graph based deep Q-network (Graph-DQN) for dialogue management. By combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with DQN to learn the embeddings of diseases and symptoms from both the structural and attribute information in the weighted heterogeneous graph, Graph-DQN could capture the symptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations better. Experimental results show that the proposed dialogue system rivals the state-of-the-art models. More importantly, the proposed dialogue system can complete the task with less dialogue turns and possess a better distinguishing capability on diseases with similar symptoms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Hyperbolic Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10367v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs have attracted a lot of research interests recently due to the success for representing complex real-world systems. However, existing methods have two pain points in embedding them into low-dimensional spaces: the mixing of structural and semantic information, and the distributional mismatch between data and embedding spaces. These two challenges require representation methods to consider the global and partial data distributions while unmixing the information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose $\text{Dis-H}^2\text{GCN}$, a Disentangled Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network. On the one hand, we leverage the mutual information minimization and discrimination maximization constraints to disentangle the semantic features from comprehensively learned representations by independent message propagation for each edge type, away from the pure structural features. On the other hand, the entire model is constructed upon the hyperbolic geometry to narrow the gap between data distributions and representing spaces. We evaluate our proposed $\text{Dis-H}^2\text{GCN}$ on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets across two downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. The results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in disentangling and representing heterogeneous graph data in hyperbolic spaces.</p></details> |  |

Despite the superior performance, insights about the predictions made from HGNs are obscure to humans. Existing explainability techniques are mainly proposed for GNNs on homogeneous graphs. They focus on highlighting salient graph objects to the predictions whereas the problem of how these objects affect the predictions remains unsolved. Given heterogeneous graphs with complex structures and rich semantics, it is imperative that salient objects can be accompanied with their influence paths to the predictions, unveiling the reasoning process of HGNs. In this paper, we develop xPath, a new framework that provides fine-grained explanations for black-box HGNs specifying a cause node with its influence path to the target node. In xPath, we differentiate the influence of a node on the prediction w.r.t. every individual influence path, and measure the influence by perturbing graph structure via a novel graph rewiring algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a greedy search algorithm to find the most influential fine-grained explanations efficiently. Empirical results on various HGNs and heterogeneous graphs show that xPath yields faithful explanations efficiently, outperforming the adaptations of advanced GNN explanation approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2023 |

However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |

However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training, which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally, this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Against Multifaceted Graph Heterogeneity via Asymmetric Federated Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02003v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to collaboratively and privately optimize graph models on divergent data for different tasks. A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

Heterogeneous graphs are commonly used to represent behaviours between different types of entities in complex industrial systems for capturing as much information about the system operations as possible. Detecting anomalous heterogeneous graphs from a large set of system behaviour graphs is crucial for many real-world applications like online web/mobile service and cloud access control. To address the problem, we propose HRGCN, an unsupervised deep heterogeneous graph neural network, to model complex heterogeneous relations between different entities in the system for effectively identifying these anomalous behaviour graphs. HRGCN trains a hierarchical relation-augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HetGNN), which learns better graph representations by modelling the interactions among all the system entities and considering both source-to-destination entity (node) types and their relation (edge) types. Extensive evaluation on two real-world application datasets shows that HRGCN outperforms state-of-the-art competing anomaly detection approaches. We further present a real-world industrial case study to justify the effectiveness of HRGCN in detecting anomalous (e.g., congested) network devices in a mobile communication service.

Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning (KCHML). This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views-molecular, elemental, and pharmacological-enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML's superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-aware Twitter Bot Detection with Relational Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02927v3)** | 2021-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twitter bot detection has become an important and challenging task to combat misinformation and protect the integrity of the online discourse. State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at AAAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[NoiseHGNN: Synthesized Similarity Graph-Based Neural Network For Noised Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18267v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph data environments intrinsically exist noise (e.g., link and structure errors) that inevitably disturb the effectiveness of graph representation and downstream learning tasks. For homogeneous graphs, the latest works use original node features to synthesize a similarity graph that can correct the structure of the noised graph. This idea is based on the homogeneity assumption, which states that similar nodes in the homogeneous graph tend to have direct links in the original graph. However, similar nodes in heterogeneous graphs usually do not have direct links, which can not be used to correct the original noise graph. This causes a significant challenge in noised heterogeneous graph learning. To this end, this paper proposes a novel synthesized similarity-based graph neural network compatible with noised heterogeneous graph learning. First, we calculate the original feature similarities of all nodes to synthesize a similarity-based high-order graph. Second, we propose a similarity-aware encoder to embed original and synthesized graphs with shared parameters. Then, instead of graph-to-graph supervising, we synchronously supervise the original and synthesized graph embeddings to predict the same labels. Meanwhile, a target-based graph extracted from the synthesized graph contrasts the structure of the metapath-based graph extracted from the original graph to learn the mutual information. Extensive experiments in numerous real-world datasets show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art records in the noised heterogeneous graph learning tasks. In highlights, +5$\sim$6\% improvements are observed in several noised datasets compared with previous SOTA methods.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08680v1)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural architecture search (HGNAS) represents a powerful tool for automatically designing effective heterogeneous graph neural networks. However, existing HGNAS algorithms suffer from inefficient searches and unstable results. In this paper, we present a new GPT-4 based HGNAS model to improve the search efficiency and search accuracy of HGNAS. Specifically, we present a new GPT-4 enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search (GHGNAS for short). The basic idea of GHGNAS is to design a set of prompts that can guide GPT-4 toward the task of generating new heterogeneous graph neural architectures. By iteratively asking GPT-4 with the prompts, GHGNAS continually validates the accuracy of the generated HGNNs and uses the feedback to further optimize the prompts. Experimental results show that GHGNAS can design new HGNNs by leveraging the powerful generalization capability of GPT-4. Moreover, GHGNAS runs more effectively and stably than previous HGNAS models based on reinforcement learning and differentiable search algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02472v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks using Self-supervised Reciprocally Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00256v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) is a very popular technique for the modeling and analysis of heterogeneous graphs. Most existing HGNN-based approaches are supervised or semi-supervised learning methods requiring graphs to be annotated, which is costly and time-consuming. Self-supervised contrastive learning has been proposed to address the problem of requiring annotated data by mining intrinsic information hidden within the given data. However, the existing contrastive learning methods are inadequate for heterogeneous graphs because they construct contrastive views only based on data perturbation or pre-defined structural properties (e.g., meta-path) in graph data while ignore the noises that may exist in both node attributes and graph topologies. We develop for the first time a novel and robust heterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach, namely HGCL, which introduces two views on respective guidance of node attributes and graph topologies and integrates and enhances them by reciprocally contrastive mechanism to better model heterogeneous graphs. In this new approach, we adopt distinct but most suitable attribute and topology fusion mechanisms in the two views, which are conducive to mining relevant information in attributes and topologies separately. We further use both attribute similarity and topological correlation to construct high-quality contrastive samples. Extensive experiments on three large real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the superiority and robustness of HGCL over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Visual Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11475v1)** | 2019-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual commonsense reasoning task aims at leading the research field into solving cognition-level reasoning with the ability of predicting correct answers and meanwhile providing convincing reasoning paths, resulting in three sub-tasks i.e., Q->A, QA->R and Q->AR. It poses great challenges over the proper semantic alignment between vision and linguistic domains and knowledge reasoning to generate persuasive reasoning paths. Existing works either resort to a powerful end-to-end network that cannot produce interpretable reasoning paths or solely explore intra-relationship of visual objects (homogeneous graph) while ignoring the cross-domain semantic alignment among visual concepts and linguistic words. In this paper, we propose a new Heterogeneous Graph Learning (HGL) framework for seamlessly integrating the intra-graph and inter-graph reasoning in order to bridge vision and language domain. Our HGL consists of a primal vision-to-answer heterogeneous graph (VAHG) module and a dual question-to-answer heterogeneous graph (QAHG) module to interactively refine reasoning paths for semantic agreement. Moreover, our HGL integrates a contextual voting module to exploit a long-range visual context for better global reasoning. Experiments on the large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed modules on three tasks (improving 5% accuracy on Q->A, 3.5% on QA->R, 5.8% on Q->AR)</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DURENDAL: Graph deep learning framework for temporal heterogeneous networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00336v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal heterogeneous networks (THNs) are evolving networks that characterize many real-world applications such as citation and events networks, recommender systems, and knowledge graphs. Although different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to dynamic graphs, most of them only support homogeneous graphs or suffer from model design heavily influenced by specific THNs prediction tasks. Furthermore, there is a lack of temporal heterogeneous networked data in current standard graph benchmark datasets. Hence, in this work, we propose DURENDAL, a graph deep learning framework for THNs. DURENDAL can help to easily repurpose any heterogeneous graph learning model to evolving networks by combining design principles from snapshot-based and multirelational message-passing graph learning models. We introduce two different schemes to update embedding representations for THNs, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of both strategies. We also extend the set of benchmarks for TNHs by introducing two novel high-resolution temporal heterogeneous graph datasets derived from an emerging Web3 platform and a well-established e-commerce website. Overall, we conducted the experimental evaluation of the framework over four temporal heterogeneous network datasets on future link prediction tasks in an evaluation setting that takes into account the evolving nature of the data. Experiments show the prediction power of DURENDAL compared to current solutions for evolving and dynamic graphs, and the effectiveness of its model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

Although graph mining research via heterogeneous graph neural networks has taken center stage, it remains unclear whether these approaches capture the heterogeneity of the PubMed database, a vast digital repository containing over 33 million articles. We introduce PubMed Graph Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph embeddings for biomedical literature. The benchmark contains rich metadata including abstract, authors, citations, MeSH terms, MeSH hierarchy, and some other information. The benchmark contains three different evaluation tasks encompassing systematic reviews, node classification, and node clustering. In PGB, we aggregate the metadata associated with the biomedical articles from PubMed into a unified source and make the benchmark publicly available for any future works.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the literature, our HGMN overcomes two major challenges: (i) capturing long-range dependencies among heterogeneous nodes and (ii) adapting SSSMs to heterogeneous graph data. Our key contribution is a general graph architecture that can solve heterogeneous nodes in real-world scenarios, followed an efficient flow. Methodologically, we introduce a two-level efficient tokenization approach that first captures long-range dependencies within identical node types, and subsequently across all node types. Empirically, we conduct comparisons between our framework and 19 state-of-the-art methods on the heterogeneous benchmarks. The extensive comparisons demonstrate that our framework outperforms other methods in both the accuracy and efficiency dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Heterogeneity in Graph Neural Networks: Lessons for Architecture Design and Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00547v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the most popular architecture for graph-level learning, including graph classification and regression tasks, which frequently arise in areas such as biochemistry and drug discovery. Achieving good performance in practice requires careful model design. Due to gaps in our understanding of the relationship between model and data characteristics, this often requires manual architecture and hyperparameter tuning. This is particularly pronounced in graph-level tasks, due to much higher variation in the input data than in node-level tasks. To work towards closing these gaps, we begin with a systematic analysis of individual performance in graph-level tasks. Our results establish significant performance heterogeneity in both message-passing and transformer-based architectures. We then investigate the interplay of model and data characteristics as drivers of the observed heterogeneity. Our results suggest that graph topology alone cannot explain heterogeneity. Using the Tree Mover's Distance, which jointly evaluates topological and feature information, we establish a link between class-distance ratios and performance heterogeneity in graph classification. These insights motivate model and data preprocessing choices that account for heterogeneity between graphs. We propose a selective rewiring approach, which only targets graphs whose individual performance benefits from rewiring. We further show that the optimal network depth depends on the graph's spectrum, which motivates a heuristic for choosing the number of GNN layers. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of both design choices in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Semantic Relation Prediction across Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05068v1)** | 2022-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic relation prediction aims to mine the implicit relationships between objects in heterogeneous graphs, which consist of different types of objects and different types of links. In real-world scenarios, new semantic relations constantly emerge and they typically appear with only a few labeled data. Since a variety of semantic relations exist in multiple heterogeneous graphs, the transferable knowledge can be mined from some existing semantic relations to help predict the new semantic relations with few labeled data. This inspires a novel problem of few-shot semantic relation prediction across heterogeneous graphs. However, the existing methods cannot solve this problem because they not only require a large number of labeled samples as input, but also focus on a single graph with a fixed heterogeneity. Targeting this novel and challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a Meta-learning based Graph neural network for Semantic relation prediction, named MetaGS. Firstly, MetaGS decomposes the graph structure between objects into multiple normalized subgraphs, then adopts a two-view graph neural network to capture local heterogeneous information and global structure information of these subgraphs. Secondly, MetaGS aggregates the information of these subgraphs with a hyper-prototypical network, which can learn from existing semantic relations and adapt to new semantic relations. Thirdly, using the well-initialized two-view graph neural network and hyper-prototypical network, MetaGS can effectively learn new semantic relations from different graphs while overcoming the limitation of few labeled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of MetaGS over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up Large-Scale Graph Processing for GPU-Accelerated Heterogeneous Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00762v1)** | 2018-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not only with the large host memory for supporting large scale graph processing, GPU-accelerated heterogeneous architecture can also provide a great potential for high-performance computing. However, few existing heterogeneous systems can exploit both hardware advantages to enable the scale-up performance for graph processing due to the limited CPU-GPU transmission efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the transmission inefficiency problem of heterogeneous graph systems. Our key insight is that the transmission efficiency for heterogeneous graph processing can be greatly improved by simply iterating each subgraph multiple times (rather than only once in prior work) in the GPU, further enabling to obtain the improvable efficiency of heterogeneous graph systems by enhancing GPU processing capability. We therefore present Seraph, with the highlights of {\em pipelined} subgraph iterations and {\em predictive} vertex updating, to cooperatively maximize the effective computations of GPU on graph processing. Our evaluation on a wide variety of large graph datasets shows that Seraph outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph systems by 5.42x (vs. Graphie) and 3.05x (vs. Garaph). Further, Seraph can be significantly scaled up over Graphie as fed with more computing power for large-scale graph processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00191v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex, multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally, we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings, efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader security-critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2HGCL: Multi-Scale Meta-Path Integrated Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01101v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the successful application of contrastive learning on graphs, researchers attempt to impose graph contrastive learning approaches on heterogeneous information networks. Orthogonal to homogeneous graphs, the types of nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs are diverse so that specialized graph contrastive learning methods are required. Most existing methods for heterogeneous graph contrastive learning are implemented by transforming heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous graphs, which may lead to ramifications that the valuable information carried by non-target nodes is undermined thereby exacerbating the performance of contrastive learning models. Additionally, current heterogeneous graph contrastive learning methods are mainly based on initial meta-paths given by the dataset, yet according to our deep-going exploration, we derive empirical conclusions: only initial meta-paths cannot contain sufficiently discriminative information; and various types of meta-paths can effectively promote the performance of heterogeneous graph contrastive learning methods. To this end, we propose a new multi-scale meta-path integrated heterogeneous graph contrastive learning (M2HGCL) model, which discards the conventional heterogeneity-homogeneity transformation and performs the graph contrastive learning in a joint manner. Specifically, we expand the meta-paths and jointly aggregate the direct neighbor information, the initial meta-path neighbor information and the expanded meta-path neighbor information to sufficiently capture discriminative information. A specific positive sampling strategy is further imposed to remedy the intrinsic deficiency of contrastive learning, i.e., the hard negative sample sampling issue. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that M2HGCL outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the conference of ADMA2023 as an Oral presentation</p></details> |

Heterogeneous network embedding aims to embed nodes into low-dimensional vectors which capture rich intrinsic information of heterogeneous networks. However, existing models either depend on manually designing meta-paths, ignore mutual effects between different semantics, or omit some aspects of information from global networks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph-Aggregated Heterogeneous Network Embedding (GAHNE), which is designed to extract the semantics of HINs as comprehensively as possible to improve the results of downstream tasks based on graph convolutional neural networks. In GAHNE model, we develop several mechanisms that can aggregate semantic representations from different single-type sub-networks as well as fuse the global information into final embeddings. Extensive experiments on three real-world HIN datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Graph Heterogeneity and Heterophily from A Spectral Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13373v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption. The code is available at the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/H2SGNN/.</p></details> |  |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

As a crucial solution to address the difficulty of user identification and unavailability of historical information, session-based recommender systems provide recommendation services that only rely on users' behaviors in the current session. However, most existing studies are not well-designed for modeling heterogeneous user behaviors and capturing the relationships between them in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely Heterogeneous Information Crossing on Graphs (HICG). HICG utilizes multiple types of user behaviors in the sessions to construct heterogeneous graphs, and captures users' current interests with their long-term preferences by effectively crossing the heterogeneous information on the graphs. In addition, we also propose an enhanced version, named HICG-CL, which incorporates contrastive learning (CL) technique to enhance item representation ability. By utilizing the item co-occurrence relationships across different sessions, HICG-CL improves the recommendation performance of HICG. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets, and the results verify that (i) HICG achieves the state-of-the-art performance by utilizing multiple types of behaviors on the heterogeneous graph. (ii) HICG-CL further significantly improves the recommendation performance of HICG by the proposed contrastive learning module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB)</p></details> |
| **[Enabling Homogeneous GNNs to Handle Heterogeneous Graphs via Relation Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11414v2)** | 2023-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been generalized to process the heterogeneous graphs by various approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches usually model the heterogeneity via various complicated modules. This paper aims to propose a simple yet effective framework to assign adequate ability to the homogeneous GNNs to handle the heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we propose Relation Embedding based Graph Neural Network (RE-GNN), which employs only one parameter per relation to embed the importance of distinct types of relations and node-type-specific self-loop connections. To optimize these relation embeddings and the model parameters simultaneously, a gradient scaling factor is proposed to constrain the embeddings to converge to suitable values. Besides, we interpret the proposed RE-GNN from two perspectives, and theoretically demonstrate that our RE-GCN possesses more expressive power than GTN (which is a typical heterogeneous GNN, and it can generate meta-paths adaptively). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RE-GNN can effectively and efficiently handle the heterogeneous graphs and can be applied to various homogeneous GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGPROMPT: Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Graphs for Few-shot Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01878v8)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) are prominent techniques for homogeneous and heterogeneous graph representation learning, yet their performance in an end-to-end supervised framework greatly depends on the availability of task-specific supervision. To reduce the labeling cost, pre-training on self-supervised pretext tasks has become a popular paradigm,but there is often a gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, stemming from the divergence in their objectives. To bridge the gap, prompt learning has risen as a promising direction especially in few-shot settings, without the need to fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. While there has been some early exploration of prompt-based learning on graphs, they primarily deal with homogeneous graphs, ignoring the heterogeneous graphs that are prevalent in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose HGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompting framework to unify not only pre-training and downstream tasks but also homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs via a dual-template design. Moreover, we propose dual-prompt in HGPROMPT to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant prior to bridge the gaps caused by not only feature variations but also heterogeneity differences across tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze HGPROMPT through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2024 main track |

Previous studies focus more on employing statistical approaches or pre-trained language models (PLMs) to extract sentence embeddings, while ignoring the rich information inherent in the heterogeneous types of interaction between words and sentences. In this paper, we are the first to propose an unsupervised extractive summarizaiton method with heterogeneous graph embeddings (HGEs) for Chinese document. A heterogeneous text graph is constructed to capture different granularities of interactions by incorporating graph structural information. Moreover, our proposed graph is general and flexible where additional nodes such as keywords can be easily integrated. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the strong baseline in three summarization datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Pricing of Recommendations and Recommending Strategically](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1619v1)** | 2009-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If you recommend a product to me and I buy it, how much should you be paid by the seller? And if your sole interest is to maximize the amount paid to you by the seller for a sequence of recommendations, how should you recommend optimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant recommendation you make? Finding an answer to these questions is a key challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties; ranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing. In the first part of this paper, we show that there can be no pricing mechanism that is "truthful" with respect to the seller, and we use solution concepts from coalitional game theory, namely the Core, the Shapley Value, and the Nash Bargaining Solution, to derive provably "fair" prices for settings with one or multiple recommenders. We then investigate pricing mechanisms for the setting where recommenders have different "purchase arguments". Here we show that it might be beneficial for the recommenders to withhold some of their arguments, unless anonymity-proof solution concepts, such as the anonymity-proof Shapley value, are used. In the second part of this paper, we analyze the setting where the recommendee loses trust in the recommender for each irrelevant recommendation. Here we prove that even if the recommendee regains her initial trust on each successful recommendation, the expected total profit the recommender can make over an infinite period is bounded. This can only be overcome when the recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any recommendation. Here, we see an interesting connection to "banner blindness", suggesting that showing fewer ads can lead to a higher long-term profit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending with Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.00979v1)** | 2021-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are a key modern application of machine learning, but they have the downside that they often draw upon sensitive user information in making their predictions. We show how to address this deficiency by basing a service's recommendation engine upon recommendations from other existing services, which contain no sensitive information by nature. Specifically, we introduce a contextual multi-armed bandit recommendation framework where the agent has access to recommendations for other services. In our setting, the user's (potentially sensitive) information belongs to a high-dimensional latent space, and the ideal recommendations for the source and target tasks (which are non-sensitive) are given by unknown linear transformations of the user information. So long as the tasks rely on similar segments of the user information, we can decompose the target recommendation problem into systematic components that can be derived from the source recommendations, and idiosyncratic components that are user-specific and cannot be derived from the source, but have significantly lower dimensionality. We propose an explore-then-refine approach to learning and utilizing this decomposition; then using ideas from perturbation theory and statistical concentration of measure, we prove our algorithm achieves regret comparable to a strong skyline that has full knowledge of the source and target transformations. We also consider a generalization of our algorithm to a model with many simultaneous targets and no source. Our methods obtain superior empirical results on synthetic benchmarks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Is News Recommendation a Sequential Recommendation Task?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08984v2)** | 2021-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommendation is often modeled as a sequential recommendation task, which assumes that there are rich short-term dependencies over historical clicked news. However, in news recommendation scenarios users usually have strong preferences on the temporal diversity of news information and may not tend to click similar news successively, which is very different from many sequential recommendation scenarios such as e-commerce recommendation. In this paper, we study whether news recommendation can be regarded as a standard sequential recommendation problem. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that modeling news recommendation as a sequential recommendation problem is suboptimal. To handle this challenge, we further propose a temporal diversity-aware news recommendation method that can promote candidate news that are diverse from recently clicked news, which can help predict future clicks more accurately. Experiments show that our approach can consistently improve various news recommendation methods.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing recommender systems, the Universal Recommender applies to any dataset that allows a semantic representation. We describe the scalable three-stage architecture of the Universal Recommender and its application to Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). To achieve good recommendation accuracy, several novel machine learning and optimization problems are identified. We finally give a brief argument supporting the need for machine learning recommenders.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; typo and references fixed</p></details> |

Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero- or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries, but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space, resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts, producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Recommender System for Recommending Smartphones to Prospective Customers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12876v2)** | 2022-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems are a subclass of machine learning systems that employ sophisticated information filtering strategies to reduce the search time and suggest the most relevant items to any particular user. Hybrid recommender systems combine multiple recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit from their complementary advantages. Some hybrid recommender systems have combined collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to build systems that are more robust. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system, which combines Alternating Least Squares (ALS) based collaborative filtering with deep learning to enhance recommendation performance as well as overcome the limitations associated with the collaborative filtering approach, especially concerning its cold start problem. In essence, we use the outputs from ALS (collaborative filtering) to influence the recommendations from a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which combines characteristic, contextual, structural and sequential information, in a big data processing framework. We have conducted several experiments in testing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid architecture in recommending smartphones to prospective customers and compared its performance with other open-source recommenders. The results have shown that the proposed system has outperformed several existing hybrid recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Expert Systems With Applications, 2022</p></details> |
| **[To Recommend or Not: Recommendability Identification in Conversations with Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18628v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current recommender systems primarily focus on what to recommend, assuming users always require personalized recommendations. However, with the widely spread of ChatGPT and other chatbots, a more crucial problem in the context of conversational systems is how to minimize user disruption when we provide recommendation services for users. While previous research has extensively explored different user intents in dialogue systems, fewer efforts are made to investigate whether recommendations should be provided. In this paper, we formally define the recommendability identification problem, which aims to determine whether recommendations are necessary in a specific scenario. First, we propose and define the recommendability identification task, which investigates the need for recommendations in the current conversational context. A new dataset is constructed. Subsequently, we discuss and evaluate the feasibility of leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) for recommendability identification. Finally, through comparative experiments, we demonstrate that directly employing PLMs with zero-shot results falls short of meeting the task requirements. Besides, fine-tuning or utilizing soft prompt techniques yields comparable results to traditional classification methods. Our work is the first to study recommendability before recommendation and provides preliminary ways to make it a fundamental component of the future recommendation system.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Deconfounded Recommender: A Causal Inference Approach to Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06581v2)** | 2019-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of recommendation is to show users items that they will like. Though usually framed as a prediction, the spirit of recommendation is to answer an interventional question---for each user and movie, what would the rating be if we "forced" the user to watch the movie? To this end, we develop a causal approach to recommendation, one where watching a movie is a "treatment" and a user's rating is an "outcome." The problem is there may be unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which movies the users watch and how they rate them; unobserved confounders impede causal predictions with observational data. To solve this problem, we develop the deconfounded recommender, a way to use classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Following Wang & Blei [23], the deconfounded recommender involves two probabilistic models. The first models which movies the users watch; it provides a substitute for the unobserved confounders. The second one models how each user rates each movie; it employs the substitute to help account for confounders. This two-stage approach removes bias due to confounding. It improves recommendation and enjoys stable performance against interventions on test sets.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Structured Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09067v1)** | 2017-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content. In many scenarios, we would like to recommend content that has structure, such as a trajectory of points-of-interests in a city, or a playlist of songs. Dubbed Structured Recommendation, this problem differs from the typical structured prediction problem in that there are multiple correct answers for a given input. Motivated by trajectory recommendation, we focus on sequential structures but in contrast to classical Viterbi decoding we require that valid predictions are sequences with no repeated elements. We propose an approach to sequence recommendation based on the structured support vector machine. For prediction, we modify the inference procedure to avoid predicting loops in the sequence. For training, we modify the objective function to account for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given input. We also modify the loss-augmented inference procedure to exclude the known ground truths. Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets show the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Visually Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10288v1)** | 2018-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images account for a significant part of user decisions in many application scenarios, such as product images in e-commerce, or user image posts in social networks. It is intuitive that user preferences on the visual patterns of image (e.g., hue, texture, color, etc) can be highly personalized, and this provides us with highly discriminative features to make personalized recommendations. Previous work that takes advantage of images for recommendation usually transforms the images into latent representation vectors, which are adopted by a recommendation component to assist personalized user/item profiling and recommendation. However, such vectors are hardly useful in terms of providing visual explanations to users about why a particular item is recommended, and thus weakens the explainability of recommendation systems. As a step towards explainable recommendation models, we propose visually explainable recommendation based on attentive neural networks to model the user attention on images, under the supervision of both implicit feedback and textual reviews. By this, we can not only provide recommendation results to the users, but also tell the users why an item is recommended by providing intuitive visual highlights in a personalized manner. Experimental results show that our models are not only able to improve the recommendation performance, but also can provide persuasive visual explanations for the users to take the recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Recommendations for Visualization Recommendations: Exploring Preferences and Priorities in Public Health](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01335v1)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of visualization recommendation systems is that analysts will be automatically provided with relevant and high-quality visualizations that will reduce the work of manual exploration or chart creation. However, little research to date has focused on what analysts value in the design of visualization recommendations. We interviewed 18 analysts in the public health sector and explored how they made sense of a popular in-domain dataset. in service of generating visualizations to recommend to others. We also explored how they interacted with a corpus of both automatically- and manually-generated visualization recommendations, with the goal of uncovering how the design values of these analysts are reflected in current visualization recommendation systems. We find that analysts champion simple charts with clear takeaways that are nonetheless connected with existing semantic information or domain hypotheses. We conclude by recommending that visualization recommendation designers explore ways of integrating context and expectation into their systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatGPT for Conversational Recommendation: Refining Recommendations by Reprompting with Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03605v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation algorithms have been pivotal in handling the overwhelming volume of online content. However, these algorithms seldom consider direct user input, resulting in superficial interaction between them. Efforts have been made to include the user directly in the recommendation process through conversation, but these systems too have had limited interactivity. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained popularity due to their ease of use and their ability to adapt dynamically to various tasks while responding to feedback. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a top-n conversational recommendation system. We build a rigorous pipeline around ChatGPT to simulate how a user might realistically probe the model for recommendations: by first instructing and then reprompting with feedback to refine a set of recommendations. We further explore the effect of popularity bias in ChatGPT's recommendations, and compare its performance to baseline models. We find that reprompting ChatGPT with feedback is an effective strategy to improve recommendation relevancy, and that popularity bias can be mitigated through prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identify Then Recommend: Towards Unsupervised Group Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23757v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Recommendation (GR), which aims to recommend items to groups of users, has become a promising and practical direction for recommendation systems. This paper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The pre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time industrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift dynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised, necessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to significant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised group recommendation framework named \underline{I}dentify \underline{T}hen \underline{R}ecommend (\underline{ITR}), where it first identifies the user groups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups, and then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group recommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first estimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher densities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic merge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision boundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the pull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group distribution. Besides, the pseudo group recommendation pre-text task is designed to assist the recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ITR on both user recommendation (e.g., 22.22\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$) and group recommendation (e.g., 22.95\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$). Furthermore, we deploy ITR on the industrial recommender and achieve promising results.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, in many settings, the end-user of the recommendations is not the only party whose needs must be represented in recommendation generation.

In this paper, we identify patterns of stakeholder utility that characterize different multistakeholder recommendation applications, and provide a taxonomy of the different possible systems, only some of which have currently been implemented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2017 Workshop on Value-Aware and Multistakeholder Recommendation</p></details> |
| **[Non-IID Recommender Systems: A Review and Framework of Recommendation Paradigm Shifting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07217v1)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recommendation plays an increasingly critical role in our living, study, work, and entertainment, the recommendations we receive are often for irrelevant, duplicate, or uninteresting products and services. A critical reason for such bad recommendations lies in the intrinsic assumption that recommended users and items are independent and identically distributed (IID) in existing theories and systems. Another phenomenon is that, while tremendous efforts have been made to model specific aspects of users or items, the overall user and item characteristics and their non-IIDness have been overlooked. In this paper, the non-IID nature and characteristics of recommendation are discussed, followed by the non-IID theoretical framework in order to build a deep and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic nature of recommendation problems, from the perspective of both couplings and heterogeneity. This non-IID recommendation research triggers the paradigm shift from IID to non-IID recommendation research and can hopefully deliver informed, relevant, personalized, and actionable recommendations. It creates exciting new directions and fundamental solutions to address various complexities including cold-start, sparse data-based, cross-domain, group-based, and shilling attack-related issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommending to Strategic Users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06559v1)** | 2023-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are pervasive in the digital economy. An important assumption in many deployed systems is that user consumption reflects user preferences in a static sense: users consume the content they like with no other considerations in mind. However, as we document in a large-scale online survey, users do choose content strategically to influence the types of content they get recommended in the future. We model this user behavior as a two-stage noisy signalling game between the recommendation system and users: the recommendation system initially commits to a recommendation policy, presents content to the users during a cold start phase which the users choose to strategically consume in order to affect the types of content they will be recommended in a recommendation phase. We show that in equilibrium, users engage in behaviors that accentuate their differences to users of different preference profiles. In addition, (statistical) minorities out of fear of losing their minority content exposition may not consume content that is liked by mainstream users. We next propose three interventions that may improve recommendation quality (both on average and for minorities) when taking into account strategic consumption: (1) Adopting a recommendation system policy that uses preferences from a prior, (2) Communicating to users that universally liked ("mainstream") content will not be used as basis of recommendation, and (3) Serving content that is personalized-enough yet expected to be liked in the beginning. Finally, we describe a methodology to inform applied theory modeling with survey results.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS, SIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation.

| **[Quality-aware News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13605v1)** | 2022-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News recommendation is a core technique used by many online news platforms. Recommending high-quality news to users is important for keeping good user experiences and news platforms' reputations. However, existing news recommendation methods mainly aim to optimize news clicks while ignoring the quality of news they recommended, which may lead to recommending news with uninformative content or even clickbaits. In this paper, we propose a quality-aware news recommendation method named QualityRec that can effectively improve the quality of recommended news. In our approach, we first propose an effective news quality evaluation method based on the distributions of users' reading dwell time on news. Next, we propose to incorporate news quality information into user interest modeling by designing a content-quality attention network to select clicked news based on both news semantics and qualities. We further train the recommendation model with an auxiliary news quality prediction task to learn quality-aware recommendation model, and we add a recommendation quality regularization loss to encourage the model to recommend higher-quality news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that QualityRec can effectively improve the overall quality of recommended news and reduce the recommendation of low-quality news, with even slightly better recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Recommendation and Temptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10595v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems based on revealed preferences often fail to capture the fundamental duality in user behavior, where consumption choices are driven by both inherent value (enrichment) and instant appeal (temptation). Consequently, these systems may generate recommendations that prioritize short-term engagement over long-lasting user satisfaction. We propose a novel recommender design that explicitly models the tension between enrichment and temptation. We introduce a behavioral model that accounts for how both enrichment and temptation influence user choices, while incorporating the reality of off-platform alternatives. Building on this model, we formulate a novel recommendation objective aligned with maximizing consumed enrichment and prove the optimality of a locally greedy recommendation strategy. Finally, we present an estimation framework that leverages the distinction between explicit user feedback and implicit choice data while making minimal assumptions about off-platform options. Through comprehensive evaluation using both synthetic simulations and real-world data from the MovieLens dataset, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines that ignore temptation dynamics either by assuming revealed preferences or recommending solely based on enrichment. Our work represents a paradigm shift toward more nuanced and user-centric recommender design, with significant implications for developing responsible AI systems that genuinely serve users' long-term interests rather than merely maximizing engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Scientific Paper Recommendation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13538v1)** | 2020-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally, recommendation services have become important due to the fact that they support e-commerce applications and different research communities. Recommender systems have a large number of applications in many fields including economic, education, and scientific research. Different empirical studies have shown that recommender systems are more effective and reliable than keyword-based search engines for extracting useful knowledge from massive amounts of data. The problem of recommending similar scientific articles in scientific community is called scientific paper recommendation. Scientific paper recommendation aims to recommend new articles or classical articles that match researchers' interests. It has become an attractive area of study since the number of scholarly papers increases exponentially. In this survey, we first introduce the importance and advantages of paper recommender systems. Second, we review the recommendation algorithms and methods, such as Content-Based methods, Collaborative Filtering methods, Graph-Based methods and Hybrid methods. Then, we introduce the evaluation methods of different recommender systems. Finally, we summarize open issues in the paper recommender systems, including cold start, sparsity, scalability, privacy, serendipity and unified scholarly data standards. The purpose of this survey is to provide comprehensive reviews on scholarly paper recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability of Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01849v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable Recommendation has been gaining attention over the last few years in industry and academia. Explanations provided along with recommendations in a recommender system framework have many uses: particularly reasoning why a suggestion is provided and how well an item aligns with a user's personalized preferences. Hence, explanations can play a huge role in influencing users to purchase products. However, the reliability of the explanations under varying scenarios has not been strictly verified from an empirical perspective. Unreliable explanations can bear strong consequences such as attackers leveraging explanations for manipulating and tempting users to purchase target items that the attackers would want to promote. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of existent feature-oriented explainable recommenders, particularly analyzing their performance under different levels of external noises added into model parameters. We conducted experiments by analyzing three important state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainable recommenders when trained on two widely used e-commerce based recommendation datasets of different scales. We observe that all the explainable models are vulnerable to increased noise levels. Experimental results verify our hypothesis that the ability to explain recommendations does decrease along with increasing noise levels and particularly adversarial noise does contribute to a much stronger decrease. Our study presents an empirical verification on the topic of robust explanations in recommender systems which can be extended to different types of explainable recommenders in RS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Collection Creation and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01004v1)** | 2021-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a collection recommender system that can automatically create and recommend collections of items at a user level. Unlike regular recommender systems, which output top-N relevant items, a collection recommender system outputs collections of items such that the items in the collections are relevant to a user, and the items within a collection follow a specific theme. Our system builds on top of the user-item representations learnt by item recommender systems. We employ dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques along with intuitive heuristics to create collections with their ratings and titles. We test these ideas in a real-world setting of music recommendation, within a popular music streaming service. We find that there is a 2.3x increase in recommendation-driven consumption when recommending collections over items. Further, it results in effective utilization of real estate and leads to recommending a more and diverse set of items.

However, despite their enormous capabilities and potential, RS may also lead to undesired effects on users, items, producers, platforms, or even the society at large, such as compromised user trust due to non-transparency, unfair treatment of different consumers, or producers, privacy concerns due to extensive use of user's private data for personalization, just to name a few. All of these create an urgent need for Trustworthy Recommender Systems (TRS) so as to mitigate or avoid such adverse impacts and risks. In this survey, we will introduce techniques related to trustworthy recommendation, including but not limited to explainable recommendation, fairness in recommendation, privacy-aware recommendation, robustness in recommendation, user-controllable recommendation, as well as the relationship between these different perspectives in terms of trustworthy recommendation. Through this survey, we hope to deliver readers with a comprehensive view of the research area and raise attention to the community about the importance, existing research achievements, and future research directions on trustworthy recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)</p></details> |
| **[Comparative Explanations of Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00670v3)** | 2022-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As recommendation is essentially a comparative (or ranking) process, a good explanation should illustrate to users why an item is believed to be better than another, i.e., comparative explanations about the recommended items. Ideally, after reading the explanations, a user should reach the same ranking of items as the system's. Unfortunately, little research attention has yet been paid on such comparative explanations. In this work, we develop an extract-and-refine architecture to explain the relative comparisons among a set of ranked items from a recommender system. For each recommended item, we first extract one sentence from its associated reviews that best suits the desired comparison against a set of reference items. Then this extracted sentence is further articulated with respect to the target user through a generative model to better explain why the item is recommended. We design a new explanation quality metric based on BLEU to guide the end-to-end training of the extraction and refinement components, which avoids generation of generic content. Extensive offline evaluations on two large recommendation benchmark datasets and serious user studies against an array of state-of-the-art explainable recommendation algorithms demonstrate the necessity of comparative explanations and the effectiveness of our solution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Preference Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13117v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems predict personalized item rankings based on user preference distributions derived from historical behavior data. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities.

| **[Detecting Sponsored Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03713v1)** | 2015-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a vast number of items, web-pages, and news to choose from, online services and the customers both benefit tremendously from personalized recommender systems. Such systems however provide great opportunities for targeted advertisements, by displaying ads alongside genuine recommendations. We consider a biased recommendation system where such ads are displayed without any tags (disguised as genuine recommendations), rendering them indistinguishable to a single user. We ask whether it is possible for a small subset of collaborating users to detect such a bias. We propose an algorithm that can detect such a bias through statistical analysis on the collaborating users' feedback. The algorithm requires only binary information indicating whether a user was satisfied with each of the recommended item or not. This makes the algorithm widely appealing to real world issues such as identification of search engine bias and pharmaceutical lobbying. We prove that the proposed algorithm detects the bias with high probability for a broad class of recommendation systems when sufficient number of users provide feedback on sufficient number of recommendations. We provide extensive simulations with real data sets and practical recommender systems, which confirm the trade offs in the theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version to appear in Sigmetrics, June 2015</p></details> |

Several approaches exist in handling paper recommender systems. While most existing recommender systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach, there are hybrid approaches that can improve recommendation accuracy using a combination of both approaches. Even though many algorithms are proposed using such methods, it is still necessary for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a recommender system method using a graph-based model associated with the similarity of users' ratings, in combination with users' demographic and location information. By utilizing the advantages of Autoencoder feature extraction, we extract new features based on all combined attributes. Using the new set of features for clustering users, our proposed approach (GHRS) has gained a significant improvement, which dominates other methods' performance in the cold-start problem. The experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many existing recommendation algorithms on recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, under review in an Elsevier journal</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Conformal Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08949v2)** | 2022-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation algorithms develop techniques that can help people to choose desirable items. However, in many real-world applications, along with a set of recommendations, it is also essential to quantify each recommendation's (un)certainty. The conformal recommender system uses the experience of a user to output a set of recommendations, each associated with a precise confidence value. Given a significance level $\varepsilon$, it provides a bound $\varepsilon$ on the probability of making a wrong recommendation. The conformal framework uses a key concept called \emph{nonconformity measure} that measures the strangeness of an item concerning other items. One of the significant design challenges of any conformal recommendation framework is integrating nonconformity measures with the recommendation algorithm. This paper introduces an inductive variant of a conformal recommender system. We propose and analyze different nonconformity measures in the inductive setting. We also provide theoretical proofs on the error-bound and the time complexity. Extensive empirical analysis on ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that the inductive variant substantially improves the performance in computation time while preserving the accuracy.</p></details> | 25 pages |

In recent years, diversity has gained tremendous attention in recommender systems research, which has been recognized to be an important factor for improving user satisfaction. On the one hand, diversified recommendation helps increase the chance of answering ephemeral user needs. On the other hand, diversifying recommendation results can help the business improve product visibility and explore potential user interests. In this paper, we are going to review the recent advances in diversified recommendation. Specifically, we first review the various definitions of diversity and generate a taxonomy to shed light on how diversity have been modeled or measured in recommender systems. After that, we summarize the major optimization approaches to diversified recommendation from a taxonomic view. Last but not the least, we project into the future and point out trending research directions on this topic.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the use of hyperbolic geometry for social recommendation. We present Hyperbolic Social Recommender (HSR), a novel social recommendation framework that utilizes hyperbolic geometry to boost the performance. With the help of hyperbolic spaces, HSR can learn high-quality user and item representations for better modeling user-item interaction and user-user social relations. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that our proposed HSR outperforms its Euclidean counterpart and state-of-the-art social recommenders in click-through rate prediction and top-K recommendation, demonstrating the effectiveness of social recommendation in the hyperbolic space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Large Recommendation Models: Emerging Trends in LLMs for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13783v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of information overload, recommendation systems play a pivotal role in filtering data and delivering personalized content. Recent advancements in feature interaction and user behavior modeling have significantly enhanced the recall and ranking processes of these systems. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to further improve recommendation systems. This tutorial explores two primary approaches for integrating LLMs: LLMs-enhanced recommendations, which leverage the reasoning capabilities of general LLMs, and generative large recommendation models, which focus on scaling and sophistication. While the former has been extensively covered in existing literature, the latter remains underexplored. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of generative large recommendation models, including their recent advancements, challenges, and potential research directions. Key topics include data quality, scaling laws, user behavior mining, and efficiency in training and inference. By engaging with this tutorial, participants will gain insights into the latest developments and future opportunities in the field, aiding both academic research and practical applications. The timely nature of this exploration supports the rapid evolution of recommendation systems, offering valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners alike.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the tutorial track at WWW 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey Paper on Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5278v4)** | 2016-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to predict users' interest on information, products and services among the tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has some typos in it</p></details> |

Impressions are a novel data source containing the items shown to users on their screens. Past research focused on providing personalized recommendations using interactions, and occasionally using impressions when such a data source was available. Interest in impressions has increased due to their potential to provide more accurate recommendations. Despite this increased interest, research in recommender systems using impressions is still dispersed. Many works have distinct interpretations of impressions and use impressions in recommender systems in numerous different manners. To unify those interpretations into a single framework, we present a systematic literature review on recommender systems using impressions, focusing on three fundamental perspectives: recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. We define a theoretical framework to delimit recommender systems using impressions and a novel paradigm for personalized recommendations, called impression-aware recommender systems. We propose a classification system for recommenders in this paradigm, which we use to categorize the recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies used in past research. Lastly, we identify open questions and future directions, highlighting missing aspects in the reviewed literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 127 references, 6 tables, 5 figures, ACM TORS ACCEPTED</p></details> |

Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers.

In this article, we review recent developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges.

In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed.

| **[Causal Embeddings for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07639v6)** | 2018-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many current applications use recommendations in order to modify the natural user behavior, such as to increase the number of sales or the time spent on a website. This results in a gap between the final recommendation objective and the classical setup where recommendation candidates are evaluated by their coherence with past user behavior, by predicting either the missing entries in the user-item matrix, or the most likely next event. To bridge this gap, we optimize a recommendation policy for the task of increasing the desired outcome versus the organic user behavior. We show this is equivalent to learning to predict recommendation outcomes under a fully random recommendation policy. To this end, we propose a new domain adaptation algorithm that learns from logged data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicts recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. We compare our method against state-of-the-art factorization methods, in addition to new approaches of causal recommendation and show significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a long paper at the Twelfth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys '18), October 2--7, 2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada</p></details> |
| **[SynerGen: Contextualized Generative Recommender for Unified Search and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21777v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce \textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for industrial-scale unified information access.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generative Recommender, Recommendation System, Information Retrieval</p></details> |
| **[Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09382v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose the first end-to-end ML-based visualization recommendation system that takes as input a large corpus of datasets and visualizations, learns a model based on this data. Then, given a new unseen dataset from an arbitrary user, the model automatically generates visualizations for that new dataset, derive scores for the visualizations, and output a list of recommended visualizations to the user ordered by effectiveness. We also describe an evaluation framework to quantitatively evaluate visualization recommendation models learned from a large corpus of visualizations and datasets. Through quantitative experiments, a user study, and qualitative analysis, we show that our end-to-end ML-based system recommends more effective and useful visualizations compared to existing state-of-the-art rule-based systems. Finally, we observed a strong preference by the human experts in our user study towards the visualizations recommended by our ML-based system as opposed to the rule-based system (5.92 from a 7-point Likert scale compared to only 3.45).</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Still, many challenges lie ahead, and this study tries to tackle some. This article first suggests a content-based fashion recommender system that uses a parallel neural network to take a single fashion item shop image as input and make in-shop recommendations by listing similar items available in the store. Next, the same structure is enhanced to personalize the results based on user preferences. This work then introduces a background augmentation technique that makes the system more robust to out-of-domain queries, enabling it to make street-to-shop recommendations using only a training set of catalog shop images. Moreover, the last contribution of this paper is a new evaluation metric for recommendation tasks called objective-guided human score. This method is an entirely customizable framework that produces interpretable, comparable scores from subjective evaluations of human scorers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 6 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Fairness of Exposure in Dynamic Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02322v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where the exposure is not fairly distributed among items in the recommendation results. This is especially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g., popular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and users' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over time resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in the literature in static recommendation environment where a single round of recommendation result is processed to improve the exposure fairness. However, less work has been done on addressing exposure bias in a dynamic recommendation setting where the system is operating over time, the recommendation model and the input data are dynamically updated with ongoing user feedback on recommended items at each round. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a dynamic recommendation setting. Our goal is to show that existing bias mitigation methods that are designed to operate in a static recommendation setting are unable to satisfy fairness of exposure for items in long run. In particular, we empirically study one of these methods and show that repeatedly applying this method fails to fairly distribute exposure among items in long run. To address this limitation, we show how this method can be adapted to effectively operate in a dynamic recommendation setting and achieve exposure fairness for items in long run. Experiments on a real-world dataset confirm that our solution is superior in achieving long-term exposure fairness for the items while maintaining the recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Today, due to their high practical relevance, research in the area of recommender systems is flourishing more than ever. However, with the new application scenarios of recommender systems that we observe today, constantly new challenges arise as well, both in terms of algorithmic requirements and with respect to the evaluation of such systems. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the traditional formulation of the recommendation problem. We then review the classical algorithmic paradigms for item retrieval and ranking and elaborate how such systems can be evaluated. Afterwards, we discuss a number of recent developments in recommender systems research, including research on session-based recommendation, biases in recommender systems, and questions regarding the impact and value of recommender systems in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[An MDP-based Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.0600v2)** | 2015-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based Recommender system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2002)</p></details> |

Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks.

However, existing recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors with videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to jointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method for efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the supplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying user preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to integrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized preference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage, recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the alignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR. Moreover, online A/B testing on KuaiShou platform verifies the practical benefits of our approach. In particular, we attain a cumulative gain of 4.13% in comment watch time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys2025</p></details> |

At the same time, studies using real user traces suggest that recommender systems are not the primary driver of attention toward extreme content; on the contrary, such content is mostly reached through other means, e.g., other websites. In this paper, we explain the following apparent paradox: if the recommendation algorithm favors extreme content, why is it not driving its consumption? With a simple agent-based model where users attribute different utilities to items in the recommender system, we show through simulations that the collaborative-filtering nature of recommender systems and the nicheness of extreme content can resolve the apparent paradox: although blindly following recommendations would indeed lead users to niche content, users rarely consume niche content when given the option because it is of low utility to them, which can lead the recommender system to deamplify such content. Our results call for a nuanced interpretation of ``algorithmic amplification'' and highlight the importance of modeling the utility of content to users when auditing recommender systems.

It begins with a synthetic overview of recommendation systems, followed by a presentation of the proprietary ARS algorithm, which is based on recommendation sessions. A mathematical model of the recommendation session, constructed using graph and network theory, serves as the input for the ARS algorithm. This paper also explores graph structure representation methods and the implementation of a G graph (representing a set of recommendation sessions) in a relational database using the SQL standard. The ARS algorithm was implemented in a working e-commerce information system, leading to the development of a fully functional recommendation system adaptable to various e-commerce IT systems. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by research on the recommendation system's parameters presented in the final section of the paper.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is maintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey.</p></details> |  |

Traditional recommender systems only focus on optimizing the utility of the end users who are the receiver of the recommendations. By contrast, multi-stakeholder recommendation attempts to generate recommendations that satisfy the needs of both the end users and other parties or stakeholders. This paper provides an overview and discussion about the multi-stakeholder recommendations from the perspective of practical applications, available data sets, corresponding research challenges and potential solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2017 Workshop on Value-Aware and Multistakeholder Recommendation</p></details> |
| **[Top-Personalized-K Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16304v1)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional top-K recommendation, which presents the top-K items with the highest ranking scores, is a common practice for generating personalized ranking lists. However, is this fixed-size top-K recommendation the optimal approach for every user's satisfaction? Not necessarily. We point out that providing fixed-size recommendations without taking into account user utility can be suboptimal, as it may unavoidably include irrelevant items or limit the exposure to relevant ones. To address this issue, we introduce Top-Personalized-K Recommendation, a new recommendation task aimed at generating a personalized-sized ranking list to maximize individual user satisfaction. As a solution to the proposed task, we develop a model-agnostic framework named PerK. PerK estimates the expected user utility by leveraging calibrated interaction probabilities, subsequently selecting the recommendation size that maximizes this expected utility. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of PerK in Top-Personalized-K recommendation task. We expect that Top-Personalized-K recommendation has the potential to offer enhanced solutions for various real-world recommendation scenarios, based on its great compatibility with existing models.</p></details> | WWW 2024 |
| **[Explanation as a Defense of Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09656v1)** | 2021-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual explanations have proved to help improve user satisfaction on machine-made recommendations. However, current mainstream solutions loosely connect the learning of explanation with the learning of recommendation: for example, they are often separately modeled as rating prediction and content generation tasks. In this work, we propose to strengthen their connection by enforcing the idea of sentiment alignment between a recommendation and its corresponding explanation. At training time, the two learning tasks are joined by a latent sentiment vector, which is encoded by the recommendation module and used to make word choices for explanation generation. At both training and inference time, the explanation module is required to generate explanation text that matches sentiment predicted by the recommendation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate our solution outperforms a rich set of baselines in both recommendation and explanation tasks, especially on the improved quality of its generated explanations. More importantly, our user studies confirm our generated explanations help users better recognize the differences between recommended items and understand why an item is recommended.</p></details> | WSDM 2021 |
| **[Utilizing FastText for Venue Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12982v1)** | 2020-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Venue recommendation systems model the past interactions (i.e., check-ins) of the users and recommend venues. Traditional recommendation systems employ collaborative filtering, content-based filtering or matrix factorization. Recently, vector space embedding and deep learning algorithms are also used for recommendation. In this work, I propose a method for recommending top-k venues by utilizing the sequentiality feature of check-ins and a recent vector space embedding method, namely the FastText. Our proposed method; forms groups of check-ins, learns the vector space representations of the venues and utilizes the learned embeddings to make venue recommendations. I measure the performance of the proposed method using a Foursquare check-in dataset.The results show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Fairness in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11159v2)** | 2022-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research on fairness-aware recommendation has mainly focused on the quantification of fairness and the development of fair recommendation models, neither of which studies a more substantial problem--identifying the underlying reason of model disparity in recommendation. This information is critical for recommender system designers to understand the intrinsic recommendation mechanism and provides insights on how to improve model fairness to decision makers. Fortunately, with the rapid development of Explainable AI, we can use model explainability to gain insights into model (un)fairness. In this paper, we study the problem of explainable fairness, which helps to gain insights about why a system is fair or unfair, and guides the design of fair recommender systems with a more informed and unified methodology. Particularly, we focus on a common setting with feature-aware recommendation and exposure unfairness, but the proposed explainable fairness framework is general and can be applied to other recommendation settings and fairness definitions. We propose a Counterfactual Explainable Fairness framework, called CEF, which generates explanations about model fairness that can improve the fairness without significantly hurting the performance.The CEF framework formulates an optimization problem to learn the "minimal" change of the input features that changes the recommendation results to a certain level of fairness. Based on the counterfactual recommendation result of each feature, we calculate an explainability score in terms of the fairness-utility trade-off to rank all the feature-based explanations, and select the top ones as fairness explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of SIGIR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Recommender Systems: Exploring Alternative Recommender Ecosystem Designs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03606v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender ecosystems are an emerging subject of research. Such research examines how the characteristics of algorithms, recommendation consumers, and item providers influence system dynamics and long-term outcomes. One architectural possibility that has not yet been widely explored in this line of research is the consequences of a configuration in which recommendation algorithms are decoupled from the platforms they serve. This is sometimes called "the friendly neighborhood algorithm store" or "middleware" model. We are particularly interested in how such architectures might offer a range of different distributions of utility across consumers, providers, and recommendation platforms. In this paper, we create a model of a recommendation ecosystem that incorporates algorithm choice and examine the outcomes of such a design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collective Mobile Sequential Recommendation: A Recommender System for Multiple Taxicabs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09372v1)** | 2019-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile sequential recommendation was originally designed to find a promising route for a single taxicab. Directly applying it for multiple taxicabs may cause an excessive overlap of recommended routes. The multi-taxicab recommendation problem is challenging and has been less studied. In this paper, we first formalize a collective mobile sequential recommendation problem based on a classic mathematical model, which characterizes time-varying influence among competing taxicabs. Next, we propose a new evaluation metric for a collection of taxicab routes aimed to minimize the sum of potential travel time. We then develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the metric and design a greedy recommendation method to approximate the solution. Finally, numerical experiments show the superiority of our methods. In trace-driven simulation, the set of routes recommended by our method significantly outperforms those obtained by conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Probabilities in Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.0498v1)** | 2010-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability in Music Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10528v1)** | 2022-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming platforms which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music Recommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AI Magazine, Special Topic on Recommender Systems 2022</p></details> |
| **[RARD: The Related-Article Recommendation Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03428v2)** | 2017-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender-system datasets are used for recommender-system evaluations, training machine-learning algorithms, and exploring user behavior. While there are many datasets for recommender systems in the domains of movies, books, and music, there are rather few datasets from research-paper recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RARD, the Related-Article Recommendation Dataset, from the digital library Sowiport and the recommendation-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. The dataset contains information about 57.4 million recommendations that were displayed to the users of Sowiport. Information includes details on which recommendation approaches were used (e.g. content-based filtering, stereotype, most popular), what types of features were used in content based filtering (simple terms vs. keyphrases), where the features were extracted from (title or abstract), and the time when recommendations were delivered and clicked. In addition, the dataset contains an implicit item-item rating matrix that was created based on the recommendation click logs. RARD enables researchers to train machine learning algorithms for research-paper recommendations, perform offline evaluations, and do research on data from Mr. DLib's recommender system, without implementing a recommender system themselves. In the field of scientific recommender systems, our dataset is unique. To the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset with more (implicit) ratings available, and that many variations of recommendation algorithms. The dataset is available at http://data.mr-dlib.org, and published under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC-BY) license.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Next Item Recommendation: Recommending and Evaluating List of Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13281v1)** | 2020-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) suggest items-based on the estimated preferences of users. Recent RS methods utilise vector space embeddings and deep learning methods to make efficient recommendations. However, most of these methods overlook the sequentiality feature and consider each interaction, e.g., check-in, independent from each other. The proposed method considers the sequentiality of the interactions of users with items and uses them to make recommendations of a list of multi-item sequences. The proposed method uses FastText \cite{bojanowski2016enriching}, a well-known technique in natural language processing (NLP), to model the relationship among the subunits of sequences, e.g., tracks, playlists, and utilises the trained representation as an input to a traditional recommendation method. The recommended lists of multi-item sequences are evaluated by the ROUGE \cite{lin2003automatic,lin2004rouge} metric, which is also commonly used in the NLP literature. The current experimental results reveal that it is possible to recommend a list of multi-item sequences, in addition to the traditional next item recommendation. Also, the usage of FastText, which utilise sub-units of the input sequences, helps to overcome cold-start user problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Tensor Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05568v1)** | 2020-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations and IRI marketing data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Continual Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04792v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025 full research paper track</p></details> |

They need a little help and inspiration. Consequently, a number of apps, services, and programs have developed recommenders around food. These cover food, meal, recipe, and restaurant recommendations, which are the most common use cases, but also other areas such as substitute ingredients, menus, and diets. The latter is especially important in the area of health and wellness where users have more specific dietary needs and goals. In this survey, we review the food recommender literature. We cover the types of systems in terms of their goals and what they are recommending, the datasets and signals that they use to train models, the technical approaches and model types used, as well as some of the system constraints.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Is ChatGPT Fair for Recommendation? Evaluating Fairness in Large Language Model Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07609v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of a novel recommendation paradigm -- Recommendation via LLM (RecLLM). Nevertheless, it is important to note that LLMs may contain social prejudices, and therefore, the fairness of recommendations made by RecLLM requires further investigation. To avoid the potential risks of RecLLM, it is imperative to evaluate the fairness of RecLLM with respect to various sensitive attributes on the user side. Due to the differences between the RecLLM paradigm and the traditional recommendation paradigm, it is problematic to directly use the fairness benchmark of traditional recommendation. To address the dilemma, we propose a novel benchmark called Fairness of Recommendation via LLM (FaiRLLM). This benchmark comprises carefully crafted metrics and a dataset that accounts for eight sensitive attributes1 in two recommendation scenarios: music and movies. By utilizing our FaiRLLM benchmark, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT and discovered that it still exhibits unfairness to some sensitive attributes when generating recommendations. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/jizhi-zhang/FaiRLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Recsys 2023 (Short)</p></details> |

| **[Learning to Counterfactually Explain Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09752v2)** | 2023-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system practitioners are facing increasing pressure to explain recommendations. We explore how to explain recommendations using counterfactual logic, i.e. "Had you not interacted with the following items, we would not recommend it." Compared to the traditional explanation logic, counterfactual explanations are easier to understand, more technically verifiable, and more informative in terms of giving users control over recommendations. The major challenge of generating such explanations is the computational cost because it requires repeatedly retraining the models to obtain the effect on a recommendation caused by the absence of user history. We propose a learning-based framework to generate counterfactual explanations. The key idea is to train a surrogate model to learn the effect of removing a subset of user history on the recommendation. To this end, we first artificially simulate the counterfactual outcomes on the recommendation after deleting subsets of history. Then we train a surrogate model to learn the mapping between a history deletion and the corresponding change of the recommendation caused by the deletion. Finally, to generate an explanation, we find the history subset predicted by the surrogate model that is most likely to remove the recommendation. Through offline experiments and online user studies, we show our method, compared to baselines, can generate explanations that are more counterfactually valid and more satisfactory considered by users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recommender for Its Purpose: Repeat and Exploration in Food Delivery Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14440v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been widely used for various scenarios, such as e-commerce, news, and music, providing online contents to help and enrich users' daily life. Different scenarios hold distinct and unique characteristics, calling for domain-specific investigations and corresponding designed recommender systems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on food delivery recommendations to unveil unique features in this domain, where users order food online and enjoy their meals shortly after delivery. We first conduct an in-depth analysis on food delivery datasets. The analysis shows that repeat orders are prevalent for both users and stores, and situations' differently influence repeat and exploration consumption in the food delivery recommender systems. Moreover, we revisit the ability of existing situation-aware methods for repeat and exploration recommendations respectively, and find them unable to effectively solve both tasks simultaneously. Based on the analysis and experiments, we have designed two separate recommendation models -- ReRec for repeat orders and ExpRec for exploration orders; both are simple in their design and computation. We conduct experiments on three real-world food delivery datasets, and our proposed models outperform various types of baselines on repeat, exploration, and combined recommendation tasks. This paper emphasizes the importance of dedicated analyses and methods for domain-specific characteristics for the recommender system studies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13286v3)** | 2019-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are known to suffer from the popularity bias problem: popular (i.e. frequently rated) items get a lot of exposure while less popular ones are under-represented in the recommendations. Research in this area has been mainly focusing on finding ways to tackle this issue by increasing the number of recommended long-tail items or otherwise the overall catalog coverage. In this paper, however, we look at this problem from the users' perspective: we want to see how popularity bias causes the recommendations to deviate from what the user expects to get from the recommender system. We define three different groups of users according to their interest in popular items (Niche, Diverse and Blockbuster-focused) and show the impact of popularity bias on the users in each group. Our experimental results on a movie dataset show that in many recommendation algorithms the recommendations the users get are extremely concentrated on popular items even if a user is interested in long-tail and non-popular items showing an extreme bias disparity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10539v3)** | 2023-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By providing explanations for users and system designers to facilitate better understanding and decision making, explainable recommendation has been an important research problem. In this paper, we propose Counterfactual Explainable Recommendation (CountER), which takes the insights of counterfactual reasoning from causal inference for explainable recommendation. CountER is able to formulate the complexity and the strength of explanations, and it adopts a counterfactual learning framework to seek simple (low complexity) and effective (high strength) explanations for the model decision. Technically, for each item recommended to each user, CountER formulates a joint optimization problem to generate minimal changes on the item aspects so as to create a counterfactual item, such that the recommendation decision on the counterfactual item is reversed. These altered aspects constitute the explanation of why the original item is recommended. The counterfactual explanation helps both the users for better understanding and the system designers for better model debugging. Another contribution of the work is the evaluation of explainable recommendation, which has been a challenging task. Fortunately, counterfactual explanations are very suitable for standard quantitative evaluation. To measure the explanation quality, we design two types of evaluation metrics, one from user's perspective (i.e. why the user likes the item), and the other from model's perspective (i.e. why the item is recommended by the model). We apply our counterfactual learning algorithm on a black-box recommender system and evaluate the generated explanations on five real-world datasets. Results show that our model generates more accurate and effective explanations than state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceeding of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2021)</p></details> |

Due to the great demand for applications, various fashion recommendation tasks, such as personalized fashion product recommendation, complementary (mix-and-match) recommendation, and outfit recommendation, have been posed and explored in the literature. The continuing research attention and advances impel us to look back and in-depth into the field for a better understanding. In this paper, we comprehensively review recent research efforts on fashion recommendation from a technological perspective. We first introduce fashion recommendation at a macro level and analyse its characteristics and differences with general recommendation tasks. We then clearly categorize different fashion recommendation efforts into several sub-tasks and focus on each sub-task in terms of its problem formulation, research focus, state-of-the-art methods, and limitations. We also summarize the datasets proposed in the literature for use in fashion recommendation studies to give readers a brief illustration. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research in this field. Overall, this survey systematically reviews the development of fashion recommendation research. It also discusses the current limitations and gaps between academic research and the real needs of the fashion industry. In the process, we offer a deep insight into how the fashion industry could benefit from the computational technologies of fashion recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Recommendation: A Survey and New Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11192v10)** | 2020-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable recommendation attempts to develop models that generate not only high-quality recommendations but also intuitive explanations. The explanations may either be post-hoc or directly come from an explainable model (also called interpretable or transparent model in some contexts). Explainable recommendation tries to address the problem of why: by providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommendation systems. It also facilitates system designers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches -- especially model-based methods -- have been proposed and applied in real-world systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review for the explainable recommendation research. We first highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W, i.e., what, when, who, where, and why. We then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation on three perspectives: 1) We provide a chronological research timeline of explainable recommendation. 2) We provide a two-dimensional taxonomy to classify existing explainable recommendation research. 3) We summarize how explainable recommendation applies to different recommendation tasks. We also devote a chapter to discuss the explanation perspectives in broader IR and AI/ML research. We end the survey by discussing potential future directions to promote the explainable recommendation research area and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>101 p...</summary><p>101 pages, published in Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 14(1), pp.1-101 (2020)</p></details> |
| **[Debiasing Recommendation with Personal Popularity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07425v2)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global popularity (GP) bias is the phenomenon that popular items are recommended much more frequently than they should be, which goes against the goal of providing personalized recommendations and harms user experience and recommendation accuracy. Many methods have been proposed to reduce GP bias but they fail to notice the fundamental problem of GP, i.e., it considers popularity from a \textit{global} perspective of \textit{all users} and uses a single set of popular items, and thus cannot capture the interests of individual users. As such, we propose a user-aware version of item popularity named \textit{personal popularity} (PP), which identifies different popular items for each user by considering the users that share similar interests. As PP models the preferences of individual users, it naturally helps to produce personalized recommendations and mitigate GP bias. To integrate PP into recommendation, we design a general \textit{personal popularity aware counterfactual} (PPAC) framework, which adapts easily to existing recommendation models. In particular, PPAC recognizes that PP and GP have both direct and indirect effects on recommendations and controls direct effects with counterfactual inference techniques for unbiased recommendations. All codes and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/Stevenn9981/PPAC}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW'24 as a research full paper</p></details> |

| **[Exploring and Exploiting Data Heterogeneity in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15431v1)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive amounts of data are the foundation of data-driven recommendation models. As an inherent nature of big data, data heterogeneity widely exists in real-world recommendation systems. It reflects the differences in the properties among sub-populations. Ignoring the heterogeneity in recommendation data could limit the performance of recommendation models, hurt the sub-populational robustness, and make the models misled by biases. However, data heterogeneity has not attracted substantial attention in the recommendation community. Therefore, it inspires us to adequately explore and exploit heterogeneity for solving the above problems and assisting data analysis. In this work, we focus on exploring two representative categories of heterogeneity in recommendation data that is the heterogeneity of prediction mechanism and covariate distribution and propose an algorithm that explores the heterogeneity through a bilevel clustering method. Furthermore, the uncovered heterogeneity is exploited for two purposes in recommendation scenarios which are prediction with multiple sub-models and supporting debias. Extensive experiments on real-world data validate the existence of heterogeneity in recommendation data and the effectiveness of exploring and exploiting data heterogeneity in recommendation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Challenging the Long Tail Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6700v1)** | 2012-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of "infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix has been largely attributed to a "long tail" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of "one-stop shopping" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems, especially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve recommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail items. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two entropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on different user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of long tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show that our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.</p></details> | VLDB2012 |
| **[Personalized Social Recommendations - Accurate or Private?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.4254v1)** | 2011-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent surge of social networks like Facebook, new forms of recommendations have become possible - personalized recommendations of ads, content, and even new friend and product connections based on one's social interactions. Since recommendations may use sensitive social information, it is speculated that these recommendations are associated with privacy risks. The main contribution of this work is in formalizing these expected trade-offs between the accuracy and privacy of personalized social recommendations. In this paper, we study whether "social recommendations", or recommendations that are solely based on a user's social network, can be made without disclosing sensitive links in the social graph. More precisely, we quantify the loss in utility when existing recommendation algorithms are modified to satisfy a strong notion of privacy, called differential privacy. We prove lower bounds on the minimum loss in utility for any recommendation algorithm that is differentially private. We adapt two privacy preserving algorithms from the differential privacy literature to the problem of social recommendations, and analyze their performance in comparison to the lower bounds, both analytically and experimentally. We show that good private social recommendations are feasible only for a small subset of the users in the social network or for a lenient setting of privacy parameters.</p></details> | VLDB2011 |
| **[Attacking Pre-trained Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03995v1)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of pioneer studies have shown the potency of pre-trained models in sequential recommendation, illuminating the path of building an omniscient unified pre-trained recommendation model for different downstream recommendation tasks. Despite these advancements, the vulnerabilities of classical recommender systems also exist in pre-trained recommendation in a new form, while the security of pre-trained recommendation model is still unexplored, which may threaten its widely practical applications. In this study, we propose a novel framework for backdoor attacking in pre-trained recommendation. We demonstrate the provider of the pre-trained model can easily insert a backdoor in pre-training, thereby increasing the exposure rates of target items to target user groups. Specifically, we design two novel and effective backdoor attacks: basic replacement and prompt-enhanced, under various recommendation pre-training usage scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed attack strategies significantly improve the exposure rates of target items to target users by hundreds of times in comparison to the clean model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Influential Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10002v2)** | 2022-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems are typically passive in that they try to adapt their recommendations to the user's historical interests. However, it is highly desirable for commercial applications, such as e-commerce, advertisement placement, and news portals, to be able to expand the users' interests so that they would accept items that they were not originally aware of or interested in to increase customer interactions. In this paper, we present Influential Recommender System (IRS), a new recommendation paradigm that aims to proactively lead a user to like a given objective item by progressively recommending to the user a sequence of carefully selected items (called an influence path). We propose the Influential Recommender Network (IRN), which is a Transformer-based sequential model to encode the items' sequential dependencies. Since different people react to external influences differently, we introduce the Personalized Impressionability Mask (PIM) to model how receptive a user is to external influence to generate the most effective influence path for the user. To evaluate IRN, we design several performance metrics to measure whether or not the influence path can smoothly expand the user interest to include the objective item while maintaining the user's satisfaction with the recommendation. Experimental results show that IRN significantly outperforms the baseline recommenders and demonstrates its capability of influencing users' interests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2023 (The 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Counterfactual Fairness in Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09829v3)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are gaining increasing and critical impacts on human and society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios. Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[RepeatNet: A Repeat Aware Neural Recommendation Machine for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02646v1)** | 2018-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks for session-based recommendation have attracted a lot of attention recently because of their promising performance. repeat consumption is a common phenomenon in many recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), where the same item is re-consumed repeatedly over time. However, no previous studies have emphasized repeat consumption with neural networks. An effective neural approach is needed to decide when to perform repeat recommendation. In this paper, we incorporate a repeat-explore mechanism into neural networks and propose a new model, called RepeatNet, with an encoder-decoder structure. RepeatNet integrates a regular neural recommendation approach in the decoder with a new repeat recommendation mechanism that can choose items from a user's history and recommends them at the right time. We report on extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. RepeatNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on all three datasets in terms of MRR and Recall. Furthermore, as the dataset size and the repeat ratio increase, the improvements of RepeatNet over the baselines also increase, which demonstrates its advantage in handling repeat recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work we argue that the post-processing algorithms aimed at only improving diversity among recommendations lead to discrimination among the users. We introduce the notion of user fairness which has been overlooked in literature so far and propose measures to quantify it. Our experiments on two diversification algorithms show that an increase in aggregate diversity results in increased disparity among the users.</p></details> |  |

We review recommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes framework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure than existing semantic recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Recommendation and Conversation via Dual Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02848v1)** | 2022-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human conversations of recommendation naturally involve the shift of interests which can align the recommendation actions and conversation process to make accurate recommendations with rich explanations. However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRS) ignore the advantage of user interest shift in connecting recommendation and conversation, which leads to an ineffective loose coupling structure of CRS. To address this issue, by modeling the recommendation actions as recommendation paths in a knowledge graph (KG), we propose DICR (Dual Imitation for Conversational Recommendation), which designs a dual imitation to explicitly align the recommendation paths and user interest shift paths in a recommendation module and a conversation module, respectively. By exchanging alignment signals, DICR achieves bidirectional promotion between recommendation and conversation modules and generates high-quality responses with accurate recommendations and coherent explanations. Experiments demonstrate that DICR outperforms the state-of-the-art models on recommendation and conversation performance with automatic, human, and novel explainability metrics.</p></details> | EMNLP 2022 |

| **[Think before Recommendation: Autonomous Reasoning-enhanced Recommender](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23077v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core task of recommender systems is to learn user preferences from historical user-item interactions. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing distillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's insufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and superficial transfer of reasoning ability. To address these issues, this paper proposes RecZero, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based recommendation paradigm that abandons the traditional multi-model and multi-stage distillation approach. Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously develop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two key components: (1) "Think-before-Recommendation" prompt construction, which employs a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise analysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2) rule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM. Additionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines supervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start reasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL. Experimental results demonstrate that RecZero and RecOne significantly outperform existing baseline methods on multiple benchmark datasets, validating the superiority of the RL paradigm in achieving autonomous reasoning-enhanced recommender systems.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |

This context is especially useful in scenarios where the cost of negative items is high for the users. In this work, we describe a new recommender algorithm that explicitly models negative user preferences in order to recommend more positive items at the top of recommendation-lists. We build upon existing machine-learning model to incorporate the contextual information provided by negative user preference. With experimental evaluations on two openly available datasets, we show that our method is able to improve recommendation quality: by improving accuracy and at the same time reducing the number of negative items at the top of recommendation-lists. Our work demonstrates the value of the contextual information provided by negative feedback, and can also be extended to signed social networks and link prediction in other networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The First International Workshop on Context-Aware Recommendation Systems with Big Data Analytics (CARS-BDA), co-organized with the 12th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 2019, Melbourne, Australia</p></details> |

These systems are then evaluated based on goals set by the aforementioned teams and other business units of the platforms operating the recommender systems. This design approach emphasizes the designers' vision for how the system can best serve the interests of users, providers, businesses, and other stakeholders. Although designers may be well-informed about user needs through user experience and market research, they are still the arbiters of the system's design and evaluation, with other stakeholders' interests less emphasized in user-centered design and evaluation. When extended to recommender systems for social good, this approach results in systems that reflect the social objectives as envisioned by the designers and evaluated as the designers understand them. Instead, social goals and operationalizations should be developed through participatory and democratic processes that are accountable to their stakeholders. We argue that recommender systems aimed at improving social good should be designed *by* and *with*, not just *for*, the people who will experience their benefits and harms. That is, they should be designed in collaboration with their users, creators, and other stakeholders as full co-designers, not only as user study participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM TORS Special Issue on Recommender Systems for Social Good</p></details> |

Users have to be supported in making (high-quality) decisions more quickly. Developers of recommender systems want to convince users to purchase specific items. Users should better understand how the recommender system works and why a specific item has been recommended. Users should also develop a more in-depth understanding of the item domain. Consequently, explanations are designed in order to achieve specific \emph{goals} such as increasing the transparency of a recommendation or increasing a user's trust in the recommender system. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing research related to explanations in recommender systems, and specifically discuss aspects relevant to group recommendation scenarios. In this context, we present different ways of explaining and visualizing recommendations determined on the basis of preference aggregation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cite ...</summary><p>Cite as: A.

| **[Latent Unexpected Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13280v1)** | 2020-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unexpected recommender system constitutes an important tool to tackle the problem of filter bubbles and user boredom, which aims at providing unexpected and satisfying recommendations to target users at the same time. Previous unexpected recommendation methods only focus on the straightforward relations between current recommendations and user expectations by modeling unexpectedness in the feature space, thus resulting in the loss of accuracy measures in order to improve unexpectedness performance. Contrast to these prior models, we propose to model unexpectedness in the latent space of user and item embeddings, which allows to capture hidden and complex relations between new recommendations and historic purchases. In addition, we develop a novel Latent Closure (LC) method to construct hybrid utility function and provide unexpected recommendations based on the proposed model. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art unexpected recommendation models, which leads to significant increase in unexpectedness measure without sacrificing any accuracy metric under all experimental settings in this paper.</p></details> | Accepted at ACM TIST |

| **[Forgetting Fast in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06875v1)** | 2022-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Users of a recommender system may want part of their data being deleted, not only from the data repository but also from the underlying machine learning model, for privacy or utility reasons. Such right-to-be-forgotten requests could be fulfilled by simply retraining the recommendation model from scratch, but that would be too slow and too expensive in practice. In this paper, we investigate fast machine unlearning techniques for recommender systems that can remove the effect of a small amount of training data from the recommendation model without incurring the full cost of retraining. A natural idea to speed this process up is to fine-tune the current recommendation model on the remaining training data instead of starting from a random initialization. This warm-start strategy indeed works for neural recommendation models using standard 1st-order neural network optimizers (like AdamW). However, we have found that even greater acceleration could be achieved by employing 2nd-order (Newton or quasi-Newton) optimization methods instead. To overcome the prohibitively high computational cost of 2nd-order optimizers, we propose a new recommendation unlearning approach AltEraser which divides the optimization problem of unlearning into many small tractable sub-problems. Extensive experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets show promising results of AltEraser in terms of consistency (forgetting thoroughness), accuracy (recommendation effectiveness), and efficiency (unlearning speed). To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt at fast approximate machine unlearning for state-of-the-art neural recommendation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Conversational Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00999v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have become increasingly popular as a powerful tool for providing personalized recommendation experiences. By directly engaging with users in a conversational manner to learn their current and fine-grained preferences, a CRS can quickly derive recommendations that are relevant and justifiable. However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) typically rely on a centralized training and deployment process, which involves collecting and storing explicitly-communicated user preferences in a centralized repository. These fine-grained user preferences are completely human-interpretable and can easily be used to infer sensitive information (e.g., financial status, political stands, and health information) about the user, if leaked or breached. To address the user privacy concerns in CRS, we first define a set of privacy protection guidelines for preserving user privacy under the conversational recommendation setting. Based on these guidelines, we propose a novel federated conversational recommendation framework that effectively reduces the risk of exposing user privacy by (i) de-centralizing both the historical interests estimation stage and the interactive preference elicitation stage and (ii) strictly bounding privacy leakage by enforcing user-level differential privacy with meticulously selected privacy budgets. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed framework not only satisfies these user privacy protection guidelines, but also enables the system to achieve competitive recommendation performance even when compared to the state-of-the-art non-private conversational recommendation approach.</p></details> | ECIR 2024 |
| **[Are Recommenders Self-Aware? Label-Free Recommendation Performance Estimation via Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23208v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method, probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items. We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings: (1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and self-evaluating recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Generating recommendations in decentralized networks is a non-trivial problem because these networks lack a global perspective due to the absence of a central authority. Further, decentralized networks are prone to Sybil Attacks in which a single malicious user can generate multiple fake or Sybil identities. Web3Recommend relies on a novel graph-based content recommendation design inspired by GraphJet, a recommendation system used in Twitter enhanced with MeritRank, a decentralized reputation scheme that provides Sybil-resistance to the system. By adding MeritRank's decay parameters to the vanilla Social Recommender Systems' personalized SALSA graph algorithm, we can provide theoretical guarantees against Sybil Attacks in the generated recommendations. Similar to GraphJet, we focus on generating real-time recommendations by only acting on recent interactions in the social network, allowing us to cater temporally contextual recommendations while keeping a tight bound on the memory usage in resource-constrained devices, allowing for a seamless user experience. As a proof-of-concept, we integrate our system with MusicDAO, an open-source Web3 music-sharing platform, to generate personalized, real-time recommendations. Thus, we provide the first Sybil-resistant Social Recommender System, allowing real-time recommendations beyond classic user-based collaborative filtering. The system is also rigorously tested with extensive unit and integration tests. Further, our experiments demonstrate the trust-relevance balance of recommendations against multiple adversarial strategies in a test network generated using data from real music platforms.</p></details> |  |

A common way to do this is contrastive learning, which uses positive and negative samples. Some recent works however have shown promising results for non-contrastive learning, which does not require negative samples. However, the non-contrastive losses have obvious "collapsed" minima, in which the encoders output a constant feature embedding, independent of the input. A folk conjecture is that so long as these collapsed solutions are avoided, the produced feature representations should be good. In our paper, we cast doubt on this story: we show through theoretical results and controlled experiments that even on simple data models, non-contrastive losses have a preponderance of non-collapsed bad minima. Moreover, we show that the training process does not avoid these minima.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the AISTATS 2022 conference (http://aistats.org/aistats2022/accepted.html)</p></details> |
| **[Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01409v1)** | 2023-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning good image representations that are beneficial to downstream tasks is a challenging task in computer vision. As such, a wide variety of self-supervised learning approaches have been proposed. Among them, contrastive learning has shown competitive performance on several benchmark datasets. The embeddings of contrastive learning are arranged on a hypersphere that results in using the inner (dot) product as a distance measurement in Euclidean space. However, the underlying structure of many scientific fields like social networks, brain imaging, and computer graphics data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent geometry. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn semantic relationships in the hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space is a continuous version of trees that naturally owns the ability to model hierarchical structures and is thus beneficial for efficient contrastive representation learning. We also extend the proposed Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning (HCL) to the supervised domain and studied the adversarial robustness of HCL. The comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves better results on self-supervised pretraining, supervised classification, and higher robust accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, behind the impressive success of CL-based techniques, their formulation often relies on heavy-computation settings, including large sample batches, extensive training epochs, etc. We are thus motivated to tackle these issues and establish a simple, efficient, yet competitive baseline of contrastive learning. Specifically, we identify, from theoretical and empirical studies, a noticeable negative-positive-coupling (NPC) effect in the widely used InfoNCE loss, leading to unsuitable learning efficiency concerning the batch size. By removing the NPC effect, we propose decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) loss, which removes the positive term from the denominator and significantly improves the learning efficiency. DCL achieves competitive performance with less sensitivity to sub-optimal hyperparameters, requiring neither large batches in SimCLR, momentum encoding in MoCo, or large epochs. We demonstrate with various benchmarks while manifesting robustness as much less sensitive to suboptimal hyperparameters. Notably, SimCLR with DCL achieves 68.2% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy using batch size 256 within 200 epochs pre-training, outperforming its SimCLR baseline by 6.4%. Further, DCL can be combined with the SOTA contrastive learning method, NNCLR, to achieve 72.3% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy with 512 batch size in 400 epochs, which represents a new SOTA in contrastive learning. We believe DCL provides a valuable baseline for future contrastive SSL studies.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2022 |
| **[Generalized Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00384v2)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent promising results of contrastive learning in the self-supervised learning paradigm, supervised contrastive learning has successfully extended these contrastive approaches to supervised contexts, outperforming cross-entropy on various datasets. However, supervised contrastive learning inherently employs label information in a binary form--either positive or negative--using a one-hot target vector. This structure struggles to adapt to methods that exploit label information as a probability distribution, such as CutMix and knowledge distillation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized supervised contrastive loss, which measures cross-entropy between label similarity and latent similarity. This concept enhances the capabilities of supervised contrastive loss by fully utilizing the label distribution and enabling the adaptation of various existing techniques for training modern neural networks. Leveraging this generalized supervised contrastive loss, we construct a tailored framework: the Generalized Supervised Contrastive Learning (GenSCL). Compared to existing contrastive learning frameworks, GenSCL incorporates additional enhancements, including advanced image-based regularization techniques and an arbitrary teacher classifier. When applied to ResNet50 with the Momentum Contrast technique, GenSCL achieves a top-1 accuracy of 77.3% on ImageNet, a 4.1% relative improvement over traditional supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, our method establishes new state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.2% and 87.0% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively when applied to ResNet50, marking the highest reported figures for this architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive UCB: Provably Efficient Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning in Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14800v3)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In view of its power in extracting feature representation, contrastive self-supervised learning has been successfully integrated into the practice of (deep) reinforcement learning (RL), leading to efficient policy learning in various applications. Despite its tremendous empirical successes, the understanding of contrastive learning for RL remains elusive. To narrow such a gap, we study how RL can be empowered by contrastive learning in a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov games (MGs) with low-rank transitions. For both models, we propose to extract the correct feature representations of the low-rank model by minimizing a contrastive loss. Moreover, under the online setting, we propose novel upper confidence bound (UCB)-type algorithms that incorporate such a contrastive loss with online RL algorithms for MDPs or MGs. We further theoretically prove that our algorithm recovers the true representations and simultaneously achieves sample efficiency in learning the optimal policy and Nash equilibrium in MDPs and MGs. We also provide empirical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the UCB-based contrastive learning method for RL. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient online RL algorithm that incorporates contrastive learning for representation learning.

| **[CCL4Rec: Contrast over Contrastive Learning for Micro-video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08024v1)** | 2022-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-video recommender systems suffer from the ubiquitous noises in users' behaviors, which might render the learned user representation indiscriminating, and lead to trivial recommendations (e.g., popular items) or even weird ones that are far beyond users' interests. Contrastive learning is an emergent technique for learning discriminating representations with random data augmentations. However, due to neglecting the noises in user behaviors and treating all augmented samples equally, the existing contrastive learning framework is insufficient for learning discriminating user representations in recommendation. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Contrast over Contrastive Learning framework for training recommender models, named CCL4Rec, which models the nuances of different augmented views by further contrasting augmented positives/negatives with adaptive pulling/pushing strengths, i.e., the contrast over (vanilla) contrastive learning. To accommodate these contrasts, we devise the hardness-aware augmentations that track the importance of behaviors being replaced in the query user and the relatedness of substitutes, and thus determining the quality of augmented positives/negatives. The hardness-aware augmentation also permits controllable contrastive learning, leading to performance gains and robust training. In this way, CCL4Rec captures the nuances of historical behaviors for a given user, which explicitly shields off the learned user representation from the effects of noisy behaviors. We conduct extensive experiments on two micro-video recommendation benchmarks, which demonstrate that CCL4Rec with far less model parameters could achieve comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art method, and improve the training/inference speed by several orders of magnitude.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tuned Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10675v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, contrastive learning based loss functions have become increasingly popular for visual self-supervised representation learning owing to their state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Most of the modern contrastive learning methods generalize only to one positive and multiple negatives per anchor. A recent state-of-the-art, supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss, extends self-supervised contrastive learning to supervised setting by generalizing to multiple positives and negatives in a batch and improves upon the cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive loss function -- Tuned Contrastive Learning (TCL) loss, that generalizes to multiple positives and negatives in a batch and offers parameters to tune and improve the gradient responses from hard positives and hard negatives. We provide theoretical analysis of our loss function's gradient response and show mathematically how it is better than that of SupCon loss. We empirically compare our loss function with SupCon loss and cross-entropy loss in supervised setting on multiple classification-task datasets to show its effectiveness. We also show the stability of our loss function to a range of hyper-parameter settings. Unlike SupCon loss which is only applied to supervised setting, we show how to extend TCL to self-supervised setting and empirically compare it with various SOTA self-supervised learning methods. Hence, we show that TCL loss achieves performance on par with SOTA methods in both supervised and self-supervised settings.</p></details> | Preprint Version |
| **[Contrastive Abstraction for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00704v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning agents with reinforcement learning is difficult when dealing with long trajectories that involve a large number of states. To address these learning problems effectively, the number of states can be reduced by abstract representations that cluster states. In principle, deep reinforcement learning can find abstract states, but end-to-end learning is unstable. We propose contrastive abstraction learning to find abstract states, where we assume that successive states in a trajectory belong to the same abstract state. Such abstract states may be basic locations, achieved subgoals, inventory, or health conditions. Contrastive abstraction learning first constructs clusters of state representations by contrastive learning and then applies modern Hopfield networks to determine the abstract states. The first phase of contrastive abstraction learning is self-supervised learning, where contrastive learning forces states with sequential proximity to have similar representations. The second phase uses modern Hopfield networks to map similar state representations to the same fixed point, i.e.\ to an abstract state. The level of abstraction can be adjusted by determining the number of fixed points of the modern Hopfield network. Furthermore, \textit{contrastive abstraction learning} does not require rewards and facilitates efficient reinforcement learning for a wide range of downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of contrastive abstraction learning for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Contrastive Learning with Kernel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05458v3)** | 2022-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional contrastive learning frameworks consider the conditional sampling procedure that constructs positive or negative data pairs conditioned on specific variables. Fair contrastive learning constructs negative pairs, for example, from the same gender (conditioning on sensitive information), which in turn reduces undesirable information from the learned representations; weakly supervised contrastive learning constructs positive pairs with similar annotative attributes (conditioning on auxiliary information), which in turn are incorporated into the representations. Although conditional contrastive learning enables many applications, the conditional sampling procedure can be challenging if we cannot obtain sufficient data pairs for some values of the conditioning variable. This paper presents Conditional Contrastive Learning with Kernel (CCL-K) that converts existing conditional contrastive objectives into alternative forms that mitigate the insufficient data problem. Instead of sampling data according to the value of the conditioning variable, CCL-K uses the Kernel Conditional Embedding Operator that samples data from all available data and assigns weights to each sampled data given the kernel similarity between the values of the conditioning variable. We conduct experiments using weakly supervised, fair, and hard negatives contrastive learning, showing CCL-K outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutual Contrastive Learning for Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12565v2)** | 2022-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a collaborative learning method called Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) for general visual representation learning. The core idea of MCL is to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of networks. A crucial component of MCL is Interactive Contrastive Learning (ICL). Compared with vanilla contrastive learning, ICL can aggregate cross-network embedding information and maximize the lower bound to the mutual information between two networks. This enables each network to learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to better feature representations for visual recognition tasks. We emphasize that the resulting MCL is conceptually simple yet empirically powerful. It is a generic framework that can be applied to both supervised and self-supervised representation learning. Experimental results on image classification and transfer learning to object detection show that MCL can lead to consistent performance gains, demonstrating that MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations.

| **[Bayesian Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07823v4)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has become a key component of self-supervised learning approaches for graph-structured data. Despite their success, existing graph contrastive learning methods are incapable of uncertainty quantification for node representations or their downstream tasks, limiting their application in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian perspective of graph contrastive learning methods showing random augmentations leads to stochastic encoders. As a result, our proposed method represents each node by a distribution in the latent space in contrast to existing techniques which embed each node to a deterministic vector. By learning distributional representations, we provide uncertainty estimates in downstream graph analytics tasks and increase the expressive power of the predictive model. In addition, we propose a Bayesian framework to infer the probability of perturbations in each view of the contrastive model, eliminating the need for a computationally expensive search for hyperparameter tuning. We empirically show a considerable improvement in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning as Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07568v2)** | 2023-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), it is easier to solve a task if given a good representation. While deep RL should automatically acquire such good representations, prior work often finds that learning representations in an end-to-end fashion is unstable and instead equip RL algorithms with additional representation learning parts (e.g., auxiliary losses, data augmentation). How can we design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In this paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an existing RL algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation learning methods can be cast as RL algorithms in their own right. To do this, we build upon prior work and apply contrastive representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in such a way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea to reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning, and then use the idea to propose a much simpler method that achieves similar performance. Across a range of goal-conditioned RL tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL methods achieve higher success rates than prior non-contrastive methods, including in the offline RL setting. We also show that contrastive RL outperforms prior methods on image-based tasks, without using data augmentation or auxiliary objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2022.

| **[Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Self-Supervised Soft Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14585v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations, or semantic similarity, between the instances. Contrastive learning implicitly learns relations but considering all negatives as noise harms the quality of the learned relations. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive learning one. Instead of hard classifying positives and negatives, we estimate from one view of a batch a continuous distribution to push or pull instances based on their semantic similarities. This target similarity distribution is sharpened to eliminate noisy relations. The model predicts for each instance, from another view, the target distribution while contrasting its positive with negatives. Experimental results show that SCE is Top-1 on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol at 100 pretraining epochs with 72.1% accuracy and is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms by reaching 75.4% for 200 epochs with multi-crop. We also show that SCE is able to generalize to several tasks.

| **[Contrastive Representation Learning: A Framework and Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05113v2)** | 2020-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Learning has recently received interest due to its success in self-supervised representation learning in the computer vision domain. However, the origins of Contrastive Learning date as far back as the 1990s and its development has spanned across many fields and domains including Metric Learning and natural language processing. In this paper we provide a comprehensive literature review and we propose a general Contrastive Representation Learning framework that simplifies and unifies many different contrastive learning methods. We also provide a taxonomy for each of the components of contrastive learning in order to summarise it and distinguish it from other forms of machine learning. We then discuss the inductive biases which are present in any contrastive learning system and we analyse our framework under different views from various sub-fields of Machine Learning. Examples of how contrastive learning has been applied in computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, and others, as well as in Reinforcement Learning are also presented. Finally, we discuss the challenges and some of the most promising future research directions ahead.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, update with the accepted version in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09401v3)** | 2022-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of big data across multiple high-impact applications, we are often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data usually consist of multiple modalities and are characterized with multiple labels, thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling complex heterogeneity with sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to obtain in real applications. Recently, researchers pay great attention to contrastive learning due to its prominent performance by utilizing rich unlabeled data. However, existing work on contrastive learning is not able to address the problem of false negative pairs, i.e., some `negative' pairs may have similar representations if they have the same label. To overcome the issues, in this paper, we propose a unified heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both the weighted unsupervised contrastive loss and the weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple types of heterogeneity. We first provide a theoretical analysis showing that the vanilla contrastive learning loss easily leads to the sub-optimal solution in the presence of false negative pairs, whereas the proposed weighted loss could automatically adjust the weight based on the similarity of the learned representations to mitigate this issue. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed framework modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD22 |
| **[Calibrating and Improving Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11525v2)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in various applications such as node classification, link prediction, and graph clustering. However, in unsupervised graph contrastive learning, some contrastive pairs may contradict the truths in downstream tasks and thus the decrease of losses on these pairs undesirably harms the performance in the downstream tasks. To assess the discrepancy between the prediction and the ground-truth in the downstream tasks for these contrastive pairs, we adapt the expected calibration error (ECE) to graph contrastive learning. The analysis of ECE motivates us to propose a novel regularization method, Contrast-Reg, to ensure that decreasing the contrastive loss leads to better performance in the downstream tasks. As a plug-in regularizer, Contrast-Reg effectively improves the performance of existing graph contrastive learning algorithms. We provide both theoretical and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of Contrast-Reg in enhancing the generalizability of the Graph Neural Network(GNN) model and improving the performance of graph contrastive algorithms with different similarity definitions and encoder backbones across various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Space Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07409v2)** | 2022-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address real-world problems and achieves huge success in the graph learning domain. Graph contrastive learning is one of the unsupervised graph representation learning methods, which recently attracts attention from researchers and has achieved state-of-the-art performances on various tasks. The key to the success of graph contrastive learning is to construct proper contrasting pairs to acquire the underlying structural semantics of the graph. However, this key part is not fully explored currently, most of the ways generating contrasting pairs focus on augmenting or perturbating graph structures to obtain different views of the input graph. But such strategies could degrade the performances via adding noise into the graph, which may narrow down the field of the applications of graph contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, namely \textbf{D}ual \textbf{S}pace \textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}ontrastive (DSGC) Learning, to conduct graph contrastive learning among views generated in different spaces including the hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. Since both spaces have their own advantages to represent graph data in the embedding spaces, we hope to utilize graph contrastive learning to bridge the spaces and leverage advantages from both sides. The comparison experiment results show that DSGC achieves competitive or better performances among all the datasets. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of different graph encoders on DSGC, giving insights about how to better leverage the advantages of contrastive learning between different spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Contrastive Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18756v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning requires learning incremental tasks with dynamic data distributions. So far, it has been observed that employing a combination of contrastive loss and distillation loss for training in continual learning yields strong performance. To the best of our knowledge, however, this contrastive continual learning framework lacks convincing theoretical explanations. In this work, we fill this gap by establishing theoretical performance guarantees, which reveal how the performance of the model is bounded by training losses of previous tasks in the contrastive continual learning framework. Our theoretical explanations further support the idea that pre-training can benefit continual learning. Inspired by our theoretical analysis of these guarantees, we propose a novel contrastive continual learning algorithm called CILA, which uses adaptive distillation coefficients for different tasks. These distillation coefficients are easily computed by the ratio between average distillation losses and average contrastive losses from previous tasks. Our method shows great improvement on standard benchmarks and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Negative Sampling Correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08690v1)** | 2024-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most effective self-supervised representation learning methods, contrastive learning (CL) relies on multiple negative pairs to contrast against each positive pair. In the standard practice of contrastive learning, data augmentation methods are utilized to generate both positive and negative pairs. While existing works have been focusing on improving the positive sampling, the negative sampling process is often overlooked. In fact, the generated negative samples are often polluted by positive samples, which leads to a biased loss and performance degradation. To correct the negative sampling bias, we propose a novel contrastive learning method named Positive-Unlabeled Contrastive Learning (PUCL). PUCL treats the generated negative samples as unlabeled samples and uses information from positive samples to correct bias in contrastive loss. We prove that the corrected loss used in PUCL only incurs a negligible bias compared to the unbiased contrastive loss. PUCL can be applied to general contrastive learning problems and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various image and graph classification tasks. The code of PUCL is in the supplementary file.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Many existing foundation models benefit from the generalization capability of contrastive self-supervised learning by learning compact and high-quality representations without relying on any label information. Amidst the explosive advancements in foundation models across multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision, a thorough survey on heterogeneous contrastive learning for the foundation model is urgently needed. In response, this survey critically evaluates the current landscape of heterogeneous contrastive learning for foundation models, highlighting the open challenges and future trends of contrastive learning. In particular, we first present how the recent advanced contrastive learning-based methods deal with view heterogeneity and how contrastive learning is applied to train and fine-tune the multi-view foundation models. Then, we move to contrastive learning methods for task heterogeneity, including pretraining tasks and downstream tasks, and show how different tasks are combined with contrastive learning loss for different purposes. Finally, we conclude this survey by discussing the open challenges and shedding light on the future directions of contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Contrastive Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04604v1)** | 2022-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning methods based on InfoNCE loss are popular in node representation learning tasks on graph-structured data. However, its reliance on data augmentation and its quadratic computational complexity might lead to inconsistency and inefficiency problems. To mitigate these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective contrastive model named Localized Graph Contrastive Learning (Local-GCL in short). Local-GCL consists of two key designs: 1) We fabricate the positive examples for each node directly using its first-order neighbors, which frees our method from the reliance on carefully-designed graph augmentations; 2) To improve the efficiency of contrastive learning on graphs, we devise a kernelized contrastive loss, which could be approximately computed in linear time and space complexity with respect to the graph size. We provide theoretical analysis to justify the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed methods. Experiments on various datasets with different scales and properties demonstrate that in spite of its simplicity, Local-GCL achieves quite competitive performance in self-supervised node representation learning tasks on graphs with various scales and properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Difficult-to-learn Examples in Contrastive Learning: A Theoretical Framework for Spectral Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01317v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised contrastive learning has shown significant performance improvements in recent years, often approaching or even rivaling supervised learning in various tasks. However, its learning mechanism is fundamentally different from that of supervised learning. Previous works have shown that difficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples around the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning, contribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps surprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples, although reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we develop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs of samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples negatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin tuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby improving performance. Empirically, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism for selecting difficult-to-learn examples and validate the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods, which substantiates the reliability of our proposed theoretical framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07317v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a complex process that necessitates the model to diminish the influence of the training data while keeping the loss of accuracy to a minimum. Despite the numerous studies on machine unlearning in recent years, the majority of them have primarily focused on supervised learning models, leaving research on contrastive learning models relatively underexplored. With the conviction that self-supervised learning harbors a promising potential, surpassing or rivaling that of supervised learning, we set out to investigate methods for machine unlearning centered around contrastive learning models. In this study, we introduce a novel gradient constraint-based approach for training the model to effectively achieve machine unlearning. Our method only necessitates a minimal number of training epochs and the identification of the data slated for unlearning. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates proficient performance not only on contrastive learning models but also on supervised learning models, showcasing its versatility and adaptability in various learning paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06491v5)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is an effective unsupervised method in graph representation learning. Recently, the data augmentation based contrastive learning method has been extended from images to graphs. However, most prior works are directly adapted from the models designed for images. Unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which are the key to the performance of contrastive learning models. This leaves much space for improvement over the existing graph contrastive learning frameworks. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view and an information regularizer, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ARIEL), to extract informative contrastive samples within a reasonable constraint. It consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods in the node classification task over various real-world datasets and further improves the robustness of graph contrastive learning.

| **[Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02990v1)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent breakthrough achieved by contrastive learning accelerates the pace for deploying unsupervised training on real-world data applications. However, unlabeled data in reality is commonly imbalanced and shows a long-tail distribution, and it is unclear how robustly the latest contrastive learning methods could perform in the practical scenario. This paper proposes to explicitly tackle this challenge, via a principled framework called Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to automatically balance the representation learning without knowing the classes. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize samples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further natural to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to learn well due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is to create a dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model, which is a pruned version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two models will lead to adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples for the current target model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the contrastive loss. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and imbalance settings show that SDCLR significantly improves not only overall accuracies but also balancedness, in terms of linear evaluation on the full-shot and few-shot settings.

One of the greatest advantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define powerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential structure of videos.

| **[Contrastive Learning as Kernel Approximation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02651v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In standard supervised machine learning, it is necessary to provide a label for every input in the data. While raw data in many application domains is easily obtainable on the Internet, manual labelling of this data is prohibitively expensive. To circumvent this issue, contrastive learning methods produce low-dimensional vector representations (also called features) of high-dimensional inputs on large unlabelled datasets. This is done by training with a contrastive loss function, which enforces that similar inputs have high inner product and dissimilar inputs have low inner product in the feature space. Rather than annotating each input individually, it suffices to define a means of sampling pairs of similar and dissimilar inputs. Contrastive features can then be fed as inputs to supervised learning systems on much smaller labelled datasets to obtain high accuracy on end tasks of interest. The goal of this thesis is to provide an overview of the current theoretical understanding of contrastive learning, specifically as it pertains to the minimizers of contrastive loss functions and their relationship to prior methods for learning features from unlabelled data. We highlight popular contrastive loss functions whose minimizers implicitly approximate a positive semidefinite (PSD) kernel. The latter is a well-studied object in functional analysis and learning theory that formalizes a notion of similarity between elements of a space. PSD kernels provide an implicit definition of features through the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's (M.Sc.)

| **[Multi-level Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02202v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a well-established paradigm in representation learning. The standard framework of contrastive learning minimizes the distance between "similar" instances and maximizes the distance between dissimilar ones in the projection space, disregarding the various aspects of similarity that can exist between two samples. Current methods rely on a single projection head, which fails to capture the full complexity of different aspects of a sample, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In this paper, we present a novel supervised contrastive learning method in a unified framework called multilevel contrastive learning (MLCL), that can be applied to both multi-label and hierarchical classification tasks. The key strength of the proposed method is the ability to capture similarities between samples across different labels and/or hierarchies using multiple projection heads. Extensive experiments on text and image datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods</p></details> |  |

We focus on one-shot classification by deep learning approach based on a small quantity of training samples. We proposed a novel deep learning approach named Local Contrast Learning (LCL) based on the key insight about a human cognitive behavior that human recognizes the objects in a specific context by contrasting the objects in the context or in her/his memory. LCL is used to train a deep model that can contrast the recognizing sample with a couple of contrastive samples randomly drawn and shuffled. On one-shot classification task on Omniglot, the deep model based LCL with 122 layers and 1.94 millions of parameters, which was trained on a tiny dataset with only 60 classes and 20 samples per class, achieved the accuracy 97.99% that outperforms human and state-of-the-art established by Bayesian Program Learning (BPL) trained on 964 classes. LCL is a fundamental idea which can be applied to alleviate parametric model's overfitting resulted by lack of training samples.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Visualizing and Understanding Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09753v3)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision, learning rich representations from unlabeled data, which generalize well to diverse vision tasks. Consequently, it has become increasingly important to explain these approaches and understand their inner workings mechanisms. Given that contrastive models are trained with interdependent and interacting inputs and aim to learn invariance through data augmentation, the existing methods for explaining single-image systems (e.g., image classification models) are inadequate as they fail to account for these factors and typically assume independent inputs. Additionally, there is a lack of evaluation metrics designed to assess pairs of explanations, and no analytical studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of different techniques used to explaining contrastive learning. In this work, we design visual explanation methods that contribute towards understanding similarity learning tasks from pairs of images. We further adapt existing metrics, used to evaluate visual explanations of image classification systems, to suit pairs of explanations and evaluate our proposed methods with these metrics. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of visual explainability methods for contrastive learning, establish their correlation with downstream tasks and demonstrate the potential of our approaches to investigate their merits and drawbacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10159v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_θ(z|x)$ as a projected normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two instantiation--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with samples from $q_θ(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04966v5)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCL), an unsupervised representation learning method that addresses the fundamental limitations of instance-wise contrastive learning. PCL not only learns low-level features for the task of instance discrimination, but more importantly, it implicitly encodes semantic structures of the data into the learned embedding space. Specifically, we introduce prototypes as latent variables to help find the maximum-likelihood estimation of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization framework. We iteratively perform E-step as finding the distribution of prototypes via clustering and M-step as optimizing the network via contrastive learning. We propose ProtoNCE loss, a generalized version of the InfoNCE loss for contrastive learning, which encourages representations to be closer to their assigned prototypes. PCL outperforms state-of-the-art instance-wise contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmarks with substantial improvement in low-resource transfer learning.

| **[Edge Contrastive Learning: An Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11075v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn representations from unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and has developed rapidly in recent years. However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art GCL methods or even some supervised GNNs, AFECL achieves SOTA performance on link prediction and semi-supervised node classification of extremely scarce labels.

| **[Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04005v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore, experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARIEL: Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06956v2)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is an effective unsupervised method in graph representation learning, and the key component of contrastive learning lies in the construction of positive and negative samples. Previous methods usually utilize the proximity of nodes in the graph as the principle. Recently, the data-augmentation-based contrastive learning method has advanced to show great power in the visual domain, and some works extended this method from images to graphs. However, unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which leaves much space for improvement. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view for data augmentation, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ARIEL), to extract informative contrastive samples within reasonable constraints. We develop a new technique called information regularization for stable training and use subgraph sampling for scalability. We generalize our method from node-level contrastive learning to the graph level by treating each graph instance as a super-node. ARIEL consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods for both node-level and graph-level classification tasks on real-world datasets. We further demonstrate that ARIEL is more robust in the face of adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2202.06491</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying and Mitigating Privacy Risks of Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04140v2)** | 2021-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is the key factor to drive the development of machine learning (ML) during the past decade. However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data, is often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data, self-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced. The objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a training sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their representation space, while different views derived from different samples more distant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative representations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML tasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on models trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative representations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy risks as well. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning through the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our experimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are less vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to attribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to the fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the latter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples expressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving contrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training. Empirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference risks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, November 2021</p></details> |
| **[Parametric Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12028v2)** | 2021-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Parametric Contrastive Learning (PaCo) to tackle long-tailed recognition. Based on theoretical analysis, we observe supervised contrastive loss tends to bias on high-frequency classes and thus increases the difficulty of imbalanced learning. We introduce a set of parametric class-wise learnable centers to rebalance from an optimization perspective. Further, we analyze our PaCo loss under a balanced setting. Our analysis demonstrates that PaCo can adaptively enhance the intensity of pushing samples of the same class close as more samples are pulled together with their corresponding centers and benefit hard example learning. Experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist 2018 manifest the new state-of-the-art for long-tailed recognition. On full ImageNet, models trained with PaCo loss surpass supervised contrastive learning across various ResNet backbones, e.g., our ResNet-200 achieves 81.8% top-1 accuracy.

| **[Multi-Similarity Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02712v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a similarity metric, contrastive methods learn a representation in which examples that are similar are pushed together and examples that are dissimilar are pulled apart. Contrastive learning techniques have been utilized extensively to learn representations for tasks ranging from image classification to caption generation. However, existing contrastive learning approaches can fail to generalize because they do not take into account the possibility of different similarity relations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-similarity contrastive loss (MSCon), that learns generalizable embeddings by jointly utilizing supervision from multiple metrics of similarity. Our method automatically learns contrastive similarity weightings based on the uncertainty in the corresponding similarity, down-weighting uncertain tasks and leading to better out-of-domain generalization to new tasks. We show empirically that networks trained with MSCon outperform state-of-the-art baselines on in-domain and out-of-domain settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06412v1)** | 2022-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is commonly used as a method of self-supervised learning with the "anchor" and "positive" being two random augmentations of a given input image, and the "negative" is the set of all other images. However, the requirement of large batch sizes and memory banks has made it difficult and slow to train. This has motivated the rise of Supervised Contrasative approaches that overcome these problems by using annotated data. We look to further improve supervised contrastive learning by ranking classes based on their similarity, and observe the impact of human bias (in the form of ranking) on the learned representations. We feel this is an important question to address, as learning good feature embeddings has been a long sought after problem in computer vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2208.06083</p></details> |

However, it still lacks important properties useful for real-world application, one of which is uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a simple way to generate uncertainty scores for many contrastive methods by re-purposing temperature, a mysterious hyperparameter used for scaling. By observing that temperature controls how sensitive the objective is to specific embedding locations, we aim to learn temperature as an input-dependent variable, treating it as a measure of embedding confidence. We call this approach "Temperature as Uncertainty", or TaU. Through experiments, we demonstrate that TaU is useful for out-of-distribution detection, while remaining competitive with benchmarks on linear evaluation. Moreover, we show that TaU can be learned on top of pretrained models, enabling uncertainty scores to be generated post-hoc with popular off-the-shelf models. In summary, TaU is a simple yet versatile method for generating uncertainties for contrastive learning.

| **[On the Importance of Contrastive Loss in Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03717v1)** | 2023-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, contrastive learning approaches (e.g., CLIP (Radford et al., 2021)) have received huge success in multimodal learning, where the model tries to minimize the distance between the representations of different views (e.g., image and its caption) of the same data point while keeping the representations of different data points away from each other. However, from a theoretical perspective, it is unclear how contrastive learning can learn the representations from different views efficiently, especially when the data is not isotropic. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of a simple multimodal contrastive learning model and show that contrastive pairs are important for the model to efficiently balance the learned representations. In particular, we show that the positive pairs will drive the model to align the representations at the cost of increasing the condition number, while the negative pairs will reduce the condition number, keeping the learned representations balanced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Classification with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08224v1)** | 2022-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A two-stage training paradigm consisting of sequential pre-training and meta-training stages has been widely used in current few-shot learning (FSL) research. Many of these methods use self-supervised learning and contrastive learning to achieve new state-of-the-art results. However, the potential of contrastive learning in both stages of FSL training paradigm is still not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based framework that seamlessly integrates contrastive learning into both stages to improve the performance of few-shot classification. In the pre-training stage, we propose a self-supervised contrastive loss in the forms of feature vector vs. feature map and feature map vs. feature map, which uses global and local information to learn good initial representations. In the meta-training stage, we propose a cross-view episodic training mechanism to perform the nearest centroid classification on two different views of the same episode and adopt a distance-scaled contrastive loss based on them. These two strategies force the model to overcome the bias between views and promote the transferability of representations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ECCV 2022</p></details> |

Their spectrum can be decomposed into three interpretable subspaces via the Hodge decomposition, resulting foundational in numerous applications. We leverage this decomposition to develop a contrastive self-supervised learning approach for processing simplicial data and generating embeddings that encapsulate specific spectral information.Specifically, we encode the pertinent data invariances through simplicial neural networks and devise augmentations that yield positive contrastive examples with suitable spectral properties for downstream tasks. Additionally, we reweight the significance of negative examples in the contrastive loss, considering the similarity of their Hodge components to the anchor. By encouraging a stronger separation among less similar instances, we obtain an embedding space that reflects the spectral properties of the data. The numerical results on two standard edge flow classification tasks show a superior performance even when compared to supervised learning techniques. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting a spectral perspective for contrastive learning with higher-order data.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

Different meta-learning approaches all work under/with the mini-batch episodic training framework. Such framework naturally gives the information about task identity, which can serve as additional supervision for meta-training to improve generalizability. We propose to exploit task identity as additional supervision in meta-training, inspired by the alignment and discrimination ability which is is intrinsic in human's fast learning. This is achieved by contrasting what meta-learners learn, i.e., model representations. The proposed ConML is evaluating and optimizing the contrastive meta-objective under a problem- and learner-agnostic meta-training framework. We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with existing meta-learners, as well as in-context learning models, and brings significant boost in performance with small implementation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received by NeurIPS2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04770v1)** | 2021-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised visual representation learning has gained much attention from the computer vision community because of the recent achievement of contrastive learning. Most of the existing contrastive learning frameworks adopt the instance discrimination as the pretext task, which treating every single instance as a different class. However, such method will inevitably cause class collision problems, which hurts the quality of the learned representation. Motivated by this observation, we introduced a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework (WCL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, our proposed framework is based on two projection heads, one of which will perform the regular instance discrimination task. The other head will use a graph-based method to explore similar samples and generate a weak label, then perform a supervised contrastive learning task based on the weak label to pull the similar images closer. We further introduced a K-Nearest Neighbor based multi-crop strategy to expand the number of positive samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate WCL improves the quality of self-supervised representations across different datasets. Notably, we get a new state-of-the-art result for semi-supervised learning. With only 1\% and 10\% labeled examples, WCL achieves 65\% and 72\% ImageNet Top-1 Accuracy using ResNet50, which is even higher than SimCLRv2 with ResNet101.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Contrastive Graph Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05100v1)** | 2023-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By treating users' interactions as a user-item graph, graph learning models have been widely deployed in Collaborative Filtering(CF) based recommendation. Recently, researchers have introduced Graph Contrastive Learning(GCL) techniques into CF to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, which first constructs contrastive views by data augmentations and then provides self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between contrastive views. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current GCL-based recommendation models are still limited as current data augmentation techniques, either structure augmentation or feature augmentation. First, structure augmentation randomly dropout nodes or edges, which is easy to destroy the intrinsic nature of the user-item graph. Second, feature augmentation imposes the same scale noise augmentation on each node, which neglects the unique characteristics of nodes on the graph. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Variational Graph Generative-Contrastive Learning(VGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we leverage variational graph reconstruction to estimate a Gaussian distribution of each node, then generate multiple contrastive views through multiple samplings from the estimated distributions, which builds a bridge between generative and contrastive learning. Besides, the estimated variances are tailored to each node, which regulates the scale of contrastive loss for each node on optimization. Considering the similarity of the estimated distributions, we propose a cluster-aware twofold contrastive learning, a node-level to encourage consistency of a node's contrastive views and a cluster-level to encourage consistency of nodes in a cluster. Finally, extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to SIGIR 2023.

However, these methods implicitly assume a particular set of representational invariances (e.g., invariance to color), and can perform poorly when a downstream task violates this assumption (e.g., distinguishing red vs. yellow cars). We introduce a contrastive learning framework which does not require prior knowledge of specific, task-dependent invariances. Our model learns to capture varying and invariant factors for visual representations by constructing separate embedding spaces, each of which is invariant to all but one augmentation. We use a multi-head network with a shared backbone which captures information across each augmentation and alone outperforms all baselines on downstream tasks. We further find that the concatenation of the invariant and varying spaces performs best across all tasks we investigate, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and few-shot downstream classification tasks, and various data corruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021</p></details> |

| **[Debiased Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00224v3)** | 2020-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prominent technique for self-supervised representation learning has been to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. Without access to labels, dissimilar (negative) points are typically taken to be randomly sampled datapoints, implicitly accepting that these points may, in reality, actually have the same label. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we observe that sampling negative examples from truly different labels improves performance, in a synthetic setting where labels are available. Motivated by this observation, we develop a debiased contrastive objective that corrects for the sampling of same-label datapoints, even without knowledge of the true labels. Empirically, the proposed objective consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for representation learning in vision, language, and reinforcement learning benchmarks. Theoretically, we establish generalization bounds for the downstream classification task.</p></details> |  |

We first analyze the inconsistency of gradient updates across clients during local training and establish its dependence on the distribution of feature representations, leading to the derivation of the supervised contrastive learning (SCL) objective to mitigate local deviations. In addition, we show that a naïve adoption of SCL in federated learning leads to representation collapse, resulting in slow convergence and limited performance gains. To address this issue, we introduce a relaxed contrastive learning loss that imposes a divergence penalty on excessively similar sample pairs within each class. This strategy prevents collapsed representations and enhances feature transferability, facilitating collaborative training and leading to significant performance improvements. Our framework outperforms all existing federated learning approaches by huge margins on the standard benchmarks through extensive experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motif-Driven Contrastive Learning of Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12533v3)** | 2021-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNN) via self-supervised contrastive learning has recently drawn lots of attention. However, most existing works focus on node-level contrastive learning, which cannot capture global graph structure. The key challenge to conducting subgraph-level contrastive learning is to sample informative subgraphs that are semantically meaningful. To solve it, we propose to learn graph motifs, which are frequently-occurring subgraph patterns (e.g. functional groups of molecules), for better subgraph sampling. Our framework MotIf-driven Contrastive leaRning Of Graph representations (MICRO-Graph) can: 1) use GNNs to extract motifs from large graph datasets; 2) leverage learned motifs to sample informative subgraphs for contrastive learning of GNN. We formulate motif learning as a differentiable clustering problem, and adopt EM-clustering to group similar and significant subgraphs into several motifs. Guided by these learned motifs, a sampler is trained to generate more informative subgraphs, and these subgraphs are used to train GNNs through graph-to-subgraph contrastive learning. By pre-training on the ogbg-molhiv dataset with MICRO-Graph, the pre-trained GNN achieves 2.04% ROC-AUC average performance enhancement on various downstream benchmark datasets, which is significantly higher than other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, not much is known about their impact on unsupervised contrastive learning (CL). This paper is the first to consider indiscriminate poisoning attacks of contrastive learning. We propose Contrastive Poisoning (CP), the first effective such attack on CL. We empirically show that Contrastive Poisoning, not only drastically reduces the performance of CL algorithms, but also attacks supervised learning models, making it the most generalizable indiscriminate poisoning attack. We also show that CL algorithms with a momentum encoder are more robust to indiscriminate poisoning, and propose a new countermeasure based on matrix completion.

Our experimentation with the SRCL model explores both pre-train/fine-tune and joint learning of the pretext (contrastive learning) and downstream (diagnostic classification) tasks.

| **[Adversarial Masking Contrastive Learning for vein recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08079v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vein recognition has received increasing attention due to its high security and privacy. Recently, deep neural networks such as Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have been introduced for vein recognition and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite the recent advances, however, existing solutions for finger-vein feature extraction are still not optimal due to scarce training image samples. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial masking contrastive learning (AMCL) approach, that generates challenging samples to train a more robust contrastive learning model for the downstream palm-vein recognition task, by alternatively optimizing the encoder in the contrastive learning model and a set of latent variables. First, a huge number of masks are generated to train a robust generative adversarial network (GAN). The trained generator transforms a latent variable from the latent variable space into a mask space. Then, we combine the trained generator with a contrastive learning model to obtain our AMCL, where the generator produces challenging masking images to increase the contrastive loss and the contrastive learning model is trained based on the harder images to learn a more robust feature representation. After training, the trained encoder in the contrastive learning model is combined with a classification layer to build a classifier, which is further fine-tuned on labeled training data for vein recognition. The experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches in terms of improving identification accuracy of vein classifiers and achieves state-of-the-art recognition results.</p></details> |  |

This work presents Masked Contrastive Representation Learning (MACRL) for self-supervised visual pre-training. In particular, MACRL leverages the effectiveness of both masked image modelling and contrastive learning. We adopt an asymmetric setting for the siamese network (i.e., encoder-decoder structure in both branches), where one branch with higher mask ratio and stronger data augmentation, while the other adopts weaker data corruptions. We optimize a contrastive learning objective based on the learned features from the encoder in both branches. Furthermore, we minimize the $L_1$ reconstruction loss according to the decoders' outputs. In our experiments, MACRL presents superior results on various vision benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and two other ImageNet subsets. Our framework provides unified insights on self-supervised visual pre-training and future research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Image and Video Soft Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11187v1)** | 2023-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method for images and videos. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. We also show that SCE reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our WACV 2023 paper to video self-supervised learning</p></details> |

We hypothesize that the clips composing the video have different distributions in short-term duration, but can represent the complicated and sophisticated video distribution through combination in a common embedding space. Thus, the proposed method represents video clips as normal distributions and combines them into a Mixture of Gaussians to model the whole video distribution. By sampling embeddings from the whole video distribution, we can circumvent the careful sampling strategy or transformations to generate augmented views of the clips, unlike previous deterministic methods that have mainly focused on such sample generation strategies for contrastive learning. We further propose a stochastic contrastive loss to learn proper video distributions and handle the inherent uncertainty from the nature of the raw video. Experimental results verify that our probabilistic embedding stands as a state-of-the-art video representation learning for action recognition and video retrieval on the most popular benchmarks, including UCF101 and HMDB51.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 |

While a series of recent works have shown statistical results for learning under contrastive loss, based either on the VC-dimension or Rademacher complexity, their algorithms are inherently inefficient or not implying PAC guarantees. In this paper, we consider contrastive learning of the fundamental concept of linear representations. Surprisingly, even under such basic setting, the existence of efficient PAC learners is largely open. We first show that the problem of contrastive PAC learning of linear representations is intractable to solve in general. We then show that it can be relaxed to a semi-definite program when the distance between contrastive samples is measured by the $\ell_2$-norm. We then establish generalization guarantees based on Rademacher complexity, and connect it to PAC guarantees under certain contrastive large-margin conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient PAC learning algorithm for contrastive learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

However, real-life recommendation scenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user influence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information to enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation. In light of this, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge transfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side information on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea forward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta networks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive contrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to benefit the recommendation performance improvement.

Recently deep-learning based PLC algorithms have demonstrated their superiority over traditional counterparts; but their concealment ability is still mostly limited to a maximum of 120ms loss. Even with strong GAN-based generative models, it is still very challenging to predict long burst losses that could happen within/in-between phonemes. In this paper, we propose to use contrastive learning to learn a loss-robust semantic representation for PLC. A hybrid neural PLC architecture combining the semantic prediction and GAN-based generative model is designed to verify its effectiveness. Results on the blind test set of Interspeech2022 PLC Challenge show its superiority over commonly used UNet-style framework and the one without contrastive learning, especially for the longer burst loss at (120, 220] ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, ICASSP 2023(Accepted)</p></details> |

However, a major challenge that hinders both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning is feature suppression, a phenomenon where the trained model captures only a limited portion of the information from the input data while overlooking other potentially valuable content. This issue often leads to indistinguishable representations for visually similar but semantically different inputs, adversely affecting downstream task performance, particularly those requiring rigorous semantic comprehension. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model-agnostic Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL) framework. Unlike standard contrastive learning which inherently captures one single biased feature distribution, MCL progressively learns previously unlearned features through feature-aware negative sampling at each stage, where the negative samples of an anchor are exclusively selected from the cluster it was assigned to in preceding stages. Meanwhile, MCL preserves the previously well-learned features by cross-stage representation integration, integrating features across all stages to form final representations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MCL's effectiveness and superiority across both unimodal and multimodal contrastive learning, spanning a range of model architectures from ResNet to Vision Transformers (ViT). Remarkably, in tasks where the original CLIP model has shown limitations, MCL dramatically enhances performance, with improvements up to threefold on specific attributes in the recently proposed MMVP benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.

While existing contrastive learning-based text clustering methods only focus on modeling instance-wise semantic similarity relationships, they ignore contextual information and underlying relationships among all instances that needs to be clustered. In this paper, we propose a novel text clustering approach called Subspace Contrastive Learning (SCL) which models cluster-wise relationships among instances. Specifically, the proposed SCL consists of two main modules: (1) a self-expressive module that constructs virtual positive samples and (2) a contrastive learning module that further learns a discriminative subspace to capture task-specific cluster-wise relationships among texts. Experimental results show that the proposed SCL method not only has achieved superior results on multiple task clustering datasets but also has less complexity in positive sample construction.</p></details> |  |

One common manner is assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and selecting positive and negative samples from pseudo-labeled samples to apply contrastive learning. However, the real-world data may be imbalanced, causing pseudo-labels to be biased toward the majority classes and further undermining the effectiveness of contrastive learning. To address the challenge, we propose Contrastive Learning with Augmented Features (CLAF). We design a class-dependent feature augmentation module to alleviate the scarcity of minority class samples in contrastive learning. For each pseudo-labeled sample, we select positive and negative samples from labeled data instead of unlabeled data to compute contrastive loss. Comprehensive experiments on imbalanced image classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CLAF in the context of imbalanced semi-supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP'2024</p></details> |

Notably, SSL exploits contrastive learning to encourage visual representations to be invariant under various image transformations. The task of gaze estimation, on the other hand, demands not just invariance to various appearances but also equivariance to the geometric transformations. In this work, we propose a simple contrastive representation learning framework for gaze estimation, named Gaze Contrastive Learning (GazeCLR). GazeCLR exploits multi-view data to promote equivariance and relies on selected data augmentation techniques that do not alter gaze directions for invariance learning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GazeCLR for several settings of the gaze estimation task. Particularly, our results show that GazeCLR improves the performance of cross-domain gaze estimation and yields as high as 17.2% relative improvement. Moreover, the GazeCLR framework is competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning methods for few-shot evaluation.

We combine the popular contrastive learning method (prototypical contrastive learning) and the classic representation learning method (autoencoder) to design an unsupervised feature learning network for hyperspectral classification. Experiments have proved that our two proposed autoencoder networks have good feature learning capabilities by themselves, and the contrastive learning network we designed can better combine the features of the two to learn more representative features. As a result, our method surpasses other comparison methods in the hyperspectral classification experiments, including some supervised methods. Moreover, our method maintains a fast feature extraction speed than baseline methods. In addition, our method reduces the requirements for huge computing resources, separates feature extraction and contrastive learning, and allows more researchers to conduct research and experiments on unsupervised contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |

We derive a particular form of contrastive loss named Joint Contrastive Learning (JCL). JCL implicitly involves the simultaneous learning of an infinite number of query-key pairs, which poses tighter constraints when searching for invariant features. We derive an upper bound on this formulation that allows analytical solutions in an end-to-end training manner. While JCL is practically effective in numerous computer vision applications, we also theoretically unveil the certain mechanisms that govern the behavior of JCL. We demonstrate that the proposed formulation harbors an innate agency that strongly favors similarity within each instance-specific class, and therefore remains advantageous when searching for discriminative features among distinct instances. We evaluate these proposals on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating considerable improvements over existing algorithms.

Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the "pushing'' operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning due to better alignment. Extensive experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show our method achieves consistent improvement over the contrastive learning baseline and sets new states of the art, e.g., 78.78\% (+2.53\% based on BERT\ba) Spearman correlation on STS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2023 Main Conference(Oral)</p></details> |

The main step in these methods is to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. However, in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the augmentation methods used in creating similar pairs with regard to contrastive learning (CL) assumptions are challenging. This is because, even simply modifying a word in the input might change the semantic meaning of the sentence, and hence, would violate the distributional hypothesis. In this review paper, we formalize the contrastive learning framework, emphasize the considerations that need to be addressed in the data transformation step, and review the state-of-the-art methods and evaluations for contrastive representation learning in NLP.

However, its efficacy is constrained as the nearest neighbor algorithm primarily identifies "easy" positive pairs, where the representations are already closely located in the embedding space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives (CLSP) that utilizes synthetic images, generated by an unconditional diffusion model, as the additional positives to help the model learn from diverse positives. Through feature interpolation in the diffusion model sampling process, we generate images with distinct backgrounds yet similar semantic content to the anchor image. These images are considered "hard" positives for the anchor image, and when included as supplementary positives in the contrastive loss, they contribute to a performance improvement of over 2% and 1% in linear evaluation compared to the previous NNCLR and All4One methods across multiple benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, achieving state-of-the-art methods. On transfer learning benchmarks, CLSP outperforms existing SSL frameworks on 6 out of 8 downstream datasets. We believe CLSP establishes a valuable baseline for future SSL studies incorporating synthetic data in the training process.</p></details> | 8 pages, conference |

While its effectiveness is not yet fully understood, a line of recent work reveals that contrastive learning can invert the data generating process and recover ground truth latent factors shared between views. In this work, we present new identifiability results for multimodal contrastive learning, showing that it is possible to recover shared factors in a more general setup than the multi-view setting studied previously. Specifically, we distinguish between the multi-view setting with one generative mechanism (e.g., multiple cameras of the same type) and the multimodal setting that is characterized by distinct mechanisms (e.g., cameras and microphones). Our work generalizes previous identifiability results by redefining the generative process in terms of distinct mechanisms with modality-specific latent variables. We prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent factors shared between modalities, even when there are nontrivial dependencies between factors. We empirically verify our identifiability results with numerical simulations and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs. Zooming out, our work provides a theoretical basis for multimodal representation learning and explains in which settings multimodal contrastive learning can be effective in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2023 camera-ready version</p></details> |

However, the quality of the learned representations is highly dependent on the data augmentation strategy applied to generate positive pairs. Positive contrastive pairs should preserve semantic meaning while discarding unwanted variations related to the data acquisition domain. Traditional contrastive pipelines attempt to simulate domain shifts through pre-defined generic image transformations. However, these do not always mimic realistic and relevant domain variations for medical imaging, such as scanner differences. To tackle this issue, we herein introduce counterfactual contrastive learning, a novel framework leveraging recent advances in causal image synthesis to create contrastive positive pairs that faithfully capture relevant domain variations. Our method, evaluated across five datasets encompassing both chest radiography and mammography data, for two established contrastive objectives (SimCLR and DINO-v2), outperforms standard contrastive learning in terms of robustness to acquisition shift. Notably, counterfactual contrastive learning achieves superior downstream performance on both in-distribution and external datasets, especially for images acquired with scanners under-represented in the training set. Further experiments show that the proposed framework extends beyond acquisition shifts, with models trained with counterfactual contrastive learning reducing subgroup disparities across biological sex.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/biomedia-mira/counterfactual-contrastive/</p></details> |
| **[Can Contrastive Learning Refine Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08701v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in contrastive learning have revolutionized self-supervised representation learning and achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tasks. While most existing methods focus on applying contrastive learning to input data modalities such as images, natural language sentences, or networks, they overlook the potential of utilizing outputs from previously trained encoders. In this paper, we introduce SIMSKIP, a novel contrastive learning framework that specifically refines input embeddings for downstream tasks. Unlike traditional unsupervised learning approaches, SIMSKIP takes advantage of the output embeddings of encoder models as its input. Through theoretical analysis, we provide evidence that applying SIMSKIP does not result in larger upper bounds on downstream task errors than those of the original embeddings, which serve as SIMSKIP's input. Experimental results on various open datasets demonstrate that the embeddings produced by SIMSKIP improve performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Max-Margin Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11450v1)** | 2021-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard contrastive learning approaches usually require a large number of negatives for effective unsupervised learning and often exhibit slow convergence. We suspect this behavior is due to the suboptimal selection of negatives used for offering contrast to the positives. We counter this difficulty by taking inspiration from support vector machines (SVMs) to present max-margin contrastive learning (MMCL). Our approach selects negatives as the sparse support vectors obtained via a quadratic optimization problem, and contrastiveness is enforced by maximizing the decision margin. As SVM optimization can be computationally demanding, especially in an end-to-end setting, we present simplifications that alleviate the computational burden. We validate our approach on standard vision benchmark datasets, demonstrating better performance in unsupervised representation learning over state-of-the-art, while having better empirical convergence properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[TCLR: Temporal Contrastive Learning for Video Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07974v4)** | 2022-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has nearly closed the gap between supervised and self-supervised learning of image representations, and has also been explored for videos. However, prior work on contrastive learning for video data has not explored the effect of explicitly encouraging the features to be distinct across the temporal dimension. We develop a new temporal contrastive learning framework consisting of two novel losses to improve upon existing contrastive self-supervised video representation learning methods. The local-local temporal contrastive loss adds the task of discriminating between non-overlapping clips from the same video, whereas the global-local temporal contrastive aims to discriminate between timesteps of the feature map of an input clip in order to increase the temporal diversity of the learned features. Our proposed temporal contrastive learning framework achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art results in various downstream video understanding tasks such as action recognition, limited-label action classification, and nearest-neighbor video retrieval on multiple video datasets and backbones. We also demonstrate significant improvement in fine-grained action classification for visually similar classes. With the commonly used 3D ResNet-18 architecture with UCF101 pretraining, we achieve 82.4\% (+5.1\% increase over the previous best) top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and 52.9\% (+5.4\% increase) on HMDB51 action classification, and 56.2\% (+11.7\% increase) Top-1 Recall on UCF101 nearest neighbor video retrieval.

In contrast to generative approaches, these contrastive models learn a deterministic encoder with no notion of uncertainty or confidence. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach based on "contrasting distributions" that learns to assign uncertainty for pretrained contrastive representations. In particular, we train a deep network from a representation to a distribution in representation space, whose variance can be used as a measure of confidence. In our experiments, we show that this deep uncertainty model can be used (1) to visually interpret model behavior, (2) to detect new noise in the input to deployed models, (3) to detect anomalies, where we outperform 10 baseline methods across 11 tasks with improvements of up to 14% absolute, and (4) to classify out-of-distribution examples where our fully unsupervised model is competitive with supervised methods.</p></details> | 8 pages main text |
| **[Contrastive Unsupervised Learning for Audio Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13540v1)** | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of video-sharing platforms has attracted more and more people to shoot videos and upload them to the Internet. These videos mostly contain a carefully-edited background audio track, where serious speech change, pitch shifting and various types of audio effects may involve, and existing audio identification systems may fail to recognize the audio. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce the idea of contrastive learning to the task of audio fingerprinting (AFP). Contrastive learning is an unsupervised approach to learn representations that can effectively group similar samples and discriminate dissimilar ones. In our work, we consider an audio track and its differently distorted versions as similar while considering different audio tracks as dissimilar. Based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) framework, we devise a contrastive learning method for AFP, which can generate fingerprints that are both discriminative and robust. A set of experiments showed that our AFP method is effective for audio identification, with robustness to serious audio distortions, including the challenging speed change and pitch shifting.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Contrast with Reconstruct: Contrastive 3D Representation Learning Guided by Generative Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02318v2)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream 3D representation learning approaches are built upon contrastive or generative modeling pretext tasks, where great improvements in performance on various downstream tasks have been achieved. However, we find these two paradigms have different characteristics: (i) contrastive models are data-hungry that suffer from a representation over-fitting issue; (ii) generative models have a data filling issue that shows inferior data scaling capacity compared to contrastive models. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of both paradigms, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose Contrast with Reconstruct (ReCon) that unifies these two paradigms. ReCon is trained to learn from both generative modeling teachers and single/cross-modal contrastive teachers through ensemble distillation, where the generative student guides the contrastive student. An encoder-decoder style ReCon-block is proposed that transfers knowledge through cross attention with stop-gradient, which avoids pretraining over-fitting and pattern difference issues. ReCon achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, e.g., 91.26% accuracy on ScanObjectNN.

| **[InfoGCL: Information-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.15438v1)** | 2021-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various graph contrastive learning models have been proposed to improve the performance of learning tasks on graph datasets in recent years. While effective and prevalent, these models are usually carefully customized. In particular, although all recent researches create two contrastive views, they differ greatly in view augmentations, architectures, and objectives. It remains an open question how to build your graph contrastive learning model from scratch for particular graph learning tasks and datasets. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by studying how graph information is transformed and transferred during the contrastive learning process and proposing an information-aware graph contrastive learning framework called InfoGCL. The key point of this framework is to follow the Information Bottleneck principle to reduce the mutual information between contrastive parts while keeping task-relevant information intact at both the levels of the individual module and the entire framework so that the information loss during graph representation learning can be minimized. We show for the first time that all recent graph contrastive learning methods can be unified by our framework. We empirically validate our theoretical analysis on both node and graph classification benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2021 |
| **[Adversarial Training with Contrastive Learning in NLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09075v1)** | 2021-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For years, adversarial training has been extensively studied in natural language processing (NLP) settings. The main goal is to make models robust so that similar inputs derive in semantically similar outcomes, which is not a trivial problem since there is no objective measure of semantic similarity in language. Previous works use an external pre-trained NLP model to tackle this challenge, introducing an extra training stage with huge memory consumption during training. However, the recent popular approach of contrastive learning in language processing hints a convenient way of obtaining such similarity restrictions. The main advantage of the contrastive learning approach is that it aims for similar data points to be mapped close to each other and further from different ones in the representation space. In this work, we propose adversarial training with contrastive learning (ATCL) to adversarially train a language processing task using the benefits of contrastive learning. The core idea is to make linear perturbations in the embedding space of the input via fast gradient methods (FGM) and train the model to keep the original and perturbed representations close via contrastive learning. In NLP experiments, we applied ATCL to language modeling and neural machine translation tasks. The results show not only an improvement in the quantitative (perplexity and BLEU) scores when compared to the baselines, but ATCL also achieves good qualitative results in the semantic level for both tasks without using a pre-trained model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Contrastive Learning in Music Video Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00347v1)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a powerful way of learning multimodal representations across various domains such as image-caption retrieval and audio-visual representation learning. In this work, we investigate if these findings generalize to the domain of music videos. Specifically, we create a dual en-coder for the audio and video modalities and train it using a bidirectional contrastive loss. For the experiments, we use an industry dataset containing 550 000 music videos as well as the public Million Song Dataset, and evaluate the quality of learned representations on the downstream tasks of music tagging and genre classification. Our results indicate that pre-trained networks without contrastive fine-tuning outperform our contrastive learning approach when evaluated on both tasks. To gain a better understanding of the reasons contrastive learning was not successful for music videos, we perform a qualitative analysis of the learned representations, revealing why contrastive learning might have difficulties uniting embeddings from two modalities. Based on these findings, we outline possible directions for future work. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we share our code and the pre-trained model.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Message Passing Perspective on Learning Dynamics of Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04435v1)** | 2023-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, contrastive learning achieves impressive results on self-supervised visual representation learning, but there still lacks a rigorous understanding of its learning dynamics. In this paper, we show that if we cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its learning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its gradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the corresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features with the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently developed in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention, graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message passing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of contrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent areas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from each other.

| **[Rethinking Weak Supervision in Helping Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04160v1)** | 2023-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has shown outstanding performances in both supervised and unsupervised learning, and has recently been introduced to solve weakly supervised learning problems such as semi-supervised learning and noisy label learning. Despite the empirical evidence showing that semi-supervised labels improve the representations of contrastive learning, it remains unknown if noisy supervised information can be directly used in training instead of after manual denoising. Therefore, to explore the mechanical differences between semi-supervised and noisy-labeled information in helping contrastive learning, we establish a unified theoretical framework of contrastive learning under weak supervision. Specifically, we investigate the most intuitive paradigm of jointly training supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses. By translating the weakly supervised information into a similarity graph under the framework of spectral clustering based on the posterior probability of weak labels, we establish the downstream classification error bound. We prove that semi-supervised labels improve the downstream error bound whereas noisy labels have limited effects under such a paradigm. Our theoretical findings here provide new insights for the community to rethink the role of weak supervision in helping contrastive learning.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2023 |
| **[Analysis of Using Sigmoid Loss for Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12613v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a prominent branch of self-supervised learning for several years. Especially, CLIP, which applies contrastive learning to large sets of captioned images, has garnered significant attention. Recently, SigLIP, a variant of CLIP, has been proposed, which uses the sigmoid loss instead of the standard InfoNCE loss. SigLIP achieves the performance comparable to CLIP in a more efficient manner by eliminating the need for a global view. However, theoretical understanding of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive learning is underexplored. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive learning, in the perspective of the geometric structure of learned embeddings. First, we propose the double-Constant Embedding Model (CCEM), a framework for parameterizing various well-known embedding structures by a single variable. Interestingly, the proposed CCEM is proven to contain the optimal embedding with respect to the sigmoid loss. Second, we mathematically analyze the optimal embedding minimizing the sigmoid loss for contrastive learning. The optimal embedding ranges from simplex equiangular-tight-frame to antipodal structure, depending on the temperature parameter used in the sigmoid loss. Third, our experimental results on synthetic datasets coincide with the theoretical results on the optimal embedding structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Wise Contrastive Learning for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06952v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world datasets, noisy labels are pervasive. The challenge of learning with noisy labels (LNL) is to train a classifier that discerns the actual classes from given instances. For this, the model must identify features indicative of the authentic labels. While research indicates that genuine label information is embedded in the learned features of even inaccurately labeled data, it's often intertwined with noise, complicating its direct application. Addressing this, we introduce channel-wise contrastive learning (CWCL). This method distinguishes authentic label information from noise by undertaking contrastive learning across diverse channels. Unlike conventional instance-wise contrastive learning (IWCL), CWCL tends to yield more nuanced and resilient features aligned with the authentic labels. Our strategy is twofold: firstly, using CWCL to extract pertinent features to identify cleanly labeled samples, and secondly, progressively fine-tuning using these samples. Evaluations on several benchmark datasets validate our method's superiority over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07713v2)** | 2022-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning has significantly been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. Most of those methods have benefited from various data augmentations that are carefully designated to maintain their identities so that the images transformed from the same instance can still be retrieved. However, those carefully designed transformations limited us to further explore the novel patterns exposed by other transformations. Meanwhile, as found in our experiments, the strong augmentations distorted the images' structures, resulting in difficult retrieval. Thus, we propose a general framework called Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations~(CLSA) to complement current contrastive learning approaches. Here, the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images over the representation bank is adopted to supervise the retrieval of strongly augmented queries from a pool of instances. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset and downstream datasets showed the information from the strongly augmented images can significantly boost the performance. For example, CLSA achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet with a standard ResNet-50 architecture with a single-layer classifier fine-tuned, which is almost the same level as 76.5% of supervised results. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/maple-research-lab/CLSA.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Twin Contrastive Learning for Online Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11680v1)** | 2022-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to perform online clustering by conducting twin contrastive learning (TCL) at the instance and cluster level. Specifically, we find that when the data is projected into a feature space with a dimensionality of the target cluster number, the rows and columns of its feature matrix correspond to the instance and cluster representation, respectively. Based on the observation, for a given dataset, the proposed TCL first constructs positive and negative pairs through data augmentations. Thereafter, in the row and column space of the feature matrix, instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning are respectively conducted by pulling together positive pairs while pushing apart the negatives. To alleviate the influence of intrinsic false-negative pairs and rectify cluster assignments, we adopt a confidence-based criterion to select pseudo-labels for boosting both the instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning. As a result, the clustering performance is further improved. Besides the elegant idea of twin contrastive learning, another advantage of TCL is that it could independently predict the cluster assignment for each instance, thus effortlessly fitting online scenarios. Extensive experiments on six widely-used image and text benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TCL. The code will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

In this study, to extend the technique of unsupervised learning to the speech domain, we propose the Momentum Contrast for VoxCeleb (MoCoVox) as a form of learning mechanism. We pre-trained the MoCoVox on the VoxCeleb1 by implementing instance discrimination. Applying MoCoVox for speaker verification revealed that it outperforms the state-of-the-art metric learning-based approach by a large margin. We also empirically demonstrate the features of contrastive learning in the speech domain by analyzing the distribution of learned representations. Furthermore, we explored which pretext task is adequate for speaker verification. We expect that learning speaker representation without human supervision helps to address the open-set speaker recognition.</p></details> |  |

Views can be generated (e.g. by augmentations) or be observed. We investigate matching when there are more than two related views which we call poly-view tasks, and derive new representation learning objectives using information maximization and sufficient statistics. We show that with unlimited computation, one should maximize the number of related views, and with a fixed compute budget, it is beneficial to decrease the number of unique samples whilst increasing the number of views of those samples. In particular, poly-view contrastive models trained for 128 epochs with batch size 256 outperform SimCLR trained for 1024 epochs at batch size 4096 on ImageNet1k, challenging the belief that contrastive models require large batch sizes and many training epochs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024. 42 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, loss pseudo-code included in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Temporal Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00966v2)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning useful data representations without requiring labels is a cornerstone of modern deep learning. Self-supervised learning methods, particularly contrastive learning (CL), have proven successful by leveraging data augmentations to define positive pairs. This success has prompted a number of theoretical studies to better understand CL and investigate theoretical bounds for downstream linear probing tasks. This work is concerned with the temporal contrastive learning (TCL) setting where the sequential structure of the data is used instead to define positive pairs, which is more commonly used in RL and robotics contexts. In this paper, we adapt recent work on Spectral CL to formulate Spectral Temporal Contrastive Learning (STCL). We discuss a population loss based on a state graph derived from a time-homogeneous reversible Markov chain with uniform stationary distribution. The STCL loss enables to connect the linear probing performance to the spectral properties of the graph, and can be estimated by considering previously observed data sequences as an ensemble of MCMC chains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice, NeurIPS Workshop, 2023</p></details> |
| **[LoCo: Local Contrastive Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01342v2)** | 2020-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural nets typically perform end-to-end backpropagation to learn the weights, a procedure that creates synchronization constraints in the weight update step across layers and is not biologically plausible. Recent advances in unsupervised contrastive representation learning point to the question of whether a learning algorithm can also be made local, that is, the updates of lower layers do not directly depend on the computation of upper layers. While Greedy InfoMax separately learns each block with a local objective, we found that it consistently hurts readout accuracy in state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning algorithms, possibly due to the greedy objective as well as gradient isolation. In this work, we discover that by overlapping local blocks stacking on top of each other, we effectively increase the decoder depth and allow upper blocks to implicitly send feedbacks to lower blocks. This simple design closes the performance gap between local learning and end-to-end contrastive learning algorithms for the first time. Aside from standard ImageNet experiments, we also show results on complex downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation directly using readout features.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2020 |

In this paper, we propose a new local contrastive feature learning (LoCL) framework, and our theme is to learn local patterns/features from tabular data. In order to create a niche for local learning, we use feature correlations to create a maximum-spanning tree, and break the tree into feature subsets, with strongly correlated features being assigned next to each other. Convolutional learning of the features is used to learn latent feature space, regulated by contrastive and reconstruction losses.

| **[Policy Contrastive Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02829v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) is a popular method that has recently achieved much success. However, the performance of AIL is still unsatisfactory on the more challenging tasks. We find that one of the major reasons is due to the low quality of AIL discriminator representation. Since the AIL discriminator is trained via binary classification that does not necessarily discriminate the policy from the expert in a meaningful way, the resulting reward might not be meaningful either. We propose a new method called Policy Contrastive Imitation Learning (PCIL) to resolve this issue. PCIL learns a contrastive representation space by anchoring on different policies and generates a smooth cosine-similarity-based reward. Our proposed representation learning objective can be viewed as a stronger version of the AIL objective and provide a more meaningful comparison between the agent and the policy. From a theoretical perspective, we show the validity of our method using the apprenticeship learning framework. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on the DeepMind Control suite demonstrates that PCIL can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Finally, qualitative results suggest that PCIL builds a smoother and more meaningful representation space for imitation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, real-life recommendation scenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user influence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information to enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation. In light of this, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge transfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side information on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea forward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta networks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive contrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to benefit the recommendation performance improvement.

| **[Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11898v1)** | 2021-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommendation based on social network has achieved great success in improving the performance of recommendation system. Since social network (user-user relations) and user-item interactions are both naturally represented as graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have thus been widely applied for social recommendation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous global graph learning framework, namely Graph Learning Augmented Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GL-HGNN) for social recommendation. GL-HGNN aims to learn a heterogeneous global graph that makes full use of user-user relations, user-item interactions and item-item similarities in a unified perspective. To this end, we design a Graph Learner (GL) method to learn and optimize user-user and item-item connections separately. Moreover, we employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to capture the high-order complex semantic relations from our learned heterogeneous global graph. To scale up the computation of graph learning, we further present the Anchor-based Graph Learner (AGL) to reduce computational complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Information Crossing on Graphs for Session-based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12940v1)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are fundamental information filtering techniques to recommend content or items that meet users' personalities and potential needs. As a crucial solution to address the difficulty of user identification and unavailability of historical information, session-based recommender systems provide recommendation services that only rely on users' behaviors in the current session. However, most existing studies are not well-designed for modeling heterogeneous user behaviors and capturing the relationships between them in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely Heterogeneous Information Crossing on Graphs (HICG). HICG utilizes multiple types of user behaviors in the sessions to construct heterogeneous graphs, and captures users' current interests with their long-term preferences by effectively crossing the heterogeneous information on the graphs. In addition, we also propose an enhanced version, named HICG-CL, which incorporates contrastive learning (CL) technique to enhance item representation ability. By utilizing the item co-occurrence relationships across different sessions, HICG-CL improves the recommendation performance of HICG. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets, and the results verify that (i) HICG achieves the state-of-the-art performance by utilizing multiple types of behaviors on the heterogeneous graph. (ii) HICG-CL further significantly improves the recommendation performance of HICG by the proposed contrastive learning module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB)</p></details> |

As a matter of fact, there exist rich and complex interactions among various types of nodes in real-world recommendation systems, which can be constructed as heterogeneous graphs. How learn representative node embedding is the basis and core of the personalized recommendation system. Meta-path is a widely used structure to capture the semantics beneath such interactions and show potential ability in improving node embedding. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Graph neural network for Recommendation (HGRec) which injects high-order semantic into node embedding via aggregating multi-hops meta-path based neighbors and fuses rich semantics via multiple meta-paths based on attention mechanism to get comprehensive node embedding. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of rich high-order semantics and also show the potentially good interpretability of HGRec.</p></details> |  |

Existing recipe recommendation systems typically focused on content-based or collaborative filtering approaches, ignoring the higher-order collaborative signal such as relational structure information among users, recipes and food items. In this paper, we formalize the problem of recipe recommendation with graphs to incorporate the collaborative signal into recipe recommendation through graph modeling. In particular, we first present URI-Graph, a new and large-scale user-recipe-ingredient graph. We then propose RecipeRec, a novel heterogeneous graph learning model for recipe recommendation. The proposed model can capture recipe content and collaborative signal through a heterogeneous graph neural network with hierarchical attention and an ingredient set transformer. We also introduce a graph contrastive augmentation strategy to extract informative graph knowledge in a self-supervised manner. Finally, we design a joint objective function of recommendation and contrastive learning to optimize the model.

| **[Tripartite Heterogeneous Graph Propagation for Large-scale Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02569v1)** | 2019-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been emerging as a promising method for relational representation including recommender systems. However, various challenging issues of social graphs hinder the practical usage of GNNs for social recommendation, such as their complex noisy connections and high heterogeneity. The oversmoothing of GNNs is an obstacle of GNN-based social recommendation as well. Here we propose a new graph embedding method Heterogeneous Graph Propagation (HGP) to tackle these issues. HGP uses a group-user-item tripartite graph as input to reduce the number of edges and the complexity of paths in a social graph. To solve the oversmoothing issue, HGP embeds nodes under a personalized PageRank based propagation scheme, separately for group-user graph and user-item graph. Node embeddings from each graph are integrated using an attention mechanism. We evaluate our HGP on a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of 1,645,279 nodes and 4,711,208 edges. The experimental results show that HGP outperforms several baselines in terms of AUC and F1-score metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted for RecSys 2019 LBR Track</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Masked Contrastive Learning for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24172v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in exploiting auxiliary information for recommendation tasks. However, graphs constructed using meta-paths in HGNNs are usually too dense and contain a large number of noise edges. The propagation mechanism of HGNNs propagates even small amounts of noise in a graph to distant neighboring nodes, thereby affecting numerous node embeddings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel model, named Masked Contrastive Learning (MCL), to enhance recommendation robustness to noise. MCL employs a random masking strategy to augment the graph via meta-paths, reducing node sensitivity to specific neighbors and bolstering embedding robustness. Furthermore, MCL employs contrastive cross-view on a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) from two perspectives: one-hop neighbors and meta-path neighbors. This approach acquires embeddings capturing both local and high-order structures simultaneously for recommendation. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm the superiority of our approach over existing recommendation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TIMBRE: Efficient Job Recommendation On Heterogeneous Graphs For Professional Recruiters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15146v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Job recommendation gathers many challenges well-known in recommender systems. First, it suffers from the cold start problem, with the user (the candidate) and the item (the job) having a very limited lifespan. It makes the learning of good user and item representations hard. Second, the temporal aspect is crucial: We cannot recommend an item in the future or too much in the past. Therefore, using solely collaborative filtering barely works. Finally, it is essential to integrate information about the users and the items, as we cannot rely only on previous interactions. This paper proposes a temporal graph-based method for job recommendation: TIMBRE (Temporal Integrated Model for Better REcommendations). TIMBRE integrates user and item information into a heterogeneous graph. This graph is adapted to allow efficient temporal recommendation and evaluation, which is later done using a graph neural network. Finally, we evaluate our approach with recommender system metrics, rarely computed on graph-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Global Graph Neural Networks for Personalized Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03813v4)** | 2022-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a challenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works rely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized recommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders capture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but ignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all sessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the current and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions over all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph that contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global co-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions comprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from the global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous global graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations with rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference Encoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels of user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively. To achieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the user current preference and historical interests to generate the final user preference representation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Graph neural network is able to encode this rich context information through propagation on the graph. However, existing heterogeneous graph neural networks neglect entanglement of the latent factors stemming from different aspects. Moreover, meta paths in existing approaches are simplified as connecting paths or side information between node pairs, overlooking the rich semantic information in the paths. In this paper, we propose a novel disentangled heterogeneous graph attention network DisenHAN for top-$N$ recommendation, which learns disentangled user/item representations from different aspects in a heterogeneous information network. In particular, we use meta relations to decompose high-order connectivity between node pairs and propose a disentangled embedding propagation layer which can iteratively identify the major aspect of meta relations. Our model aggregates corresponding aspect features from each meta relation for the target user/item. With different layers of embedding propagation, DisenHAN is able to explicitly capture the collaborative filtering effect semantically. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that DisenHAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the learned disentangled representations via insightful case studies and visualization.</p></details> | Accepted at CIKM2020 |
| **[Enhancing Clinical Evidence Recommendation with Multi-Channel Heterogeneous Learning on Evidence Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01242v1)** | 2023-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical evidence encompasses the associations and impacts between patients, interventions (such as drugs or physiotherapy), problems, and outcomes. The goal of recommending clinical evidence is to provide medical practitioners with relevant information to support their decision-making processes and to generate new evidence. Our specific task focuses on recommending evidence based on clinical problems. However, the direct connections between certain clinical problems and related evidence are often sparse, creating a challenge of link sparsity. Additionally, to recommend appropriate evidence, it is essential to jointly exploit both topological relationships among evidence and textual information describing them. To address these challenges, we define two knowledge graphs: an Evidence Co-reference Graph and an Evidence Text Graph, to represent the topological and linguistic relations among evidential elements, respectively. We also introduce a multi-channel heterogeneous learning model and a fusional attention mechanism to handle the co-reference-text heterogeneity in evidence recommendation. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open data.</p></details> |  |
| **[RankGraph: Unified Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02942v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models (FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |

The current studies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items in the user's session sequence. However, other effective information in the session sequence, such as user profiles, are largely ignored which may lead to the model unable to learn the user's specific preferences. In this paper, we propose SR-HetGNN, a novel session recommendation method that uses a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) to learn session embeddings and capture the specific preferences of anonymous users. Specifically, SR-HetGNN first constructs heterogeneous graphs containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN captures the complex transitions between items and learns the item embeddings containing user information. Finally, local and global session embeddings are combined with the attentional network to obtain the final session embedding, considering the influence of users' long and short-term preferences. SR-HetGNN is shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods through extensive experiments over two real large datasets Diginetica and Tmall.</p></details> |  |
| **[API Usage Recommendation via Multi-View Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01971v1)** | 2022-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers often need to decide which APIs to use for the functions being implemented. With the ever-growing number of APIs and libraries, it becomes increasingly difficult for developers to find appropriate APIs, indicating the necessity of automatic API usage recommendation. Previous studies adopt statistical models or collaborative filtering methods to mine the implicit API usage patterns for recommendation. However, they rely on the occurrence frequencies of APIs for mining usage patterns, thus prone to fail for the low-frequency APIs. Besides, prior studies generally regard the API call interaction graph as homogeneous graph, ignoring the rich information (e.g., edge types) in the structure graph. In this work, we propose a novel method named MEGA for improving the recommendation accuracy especially for the low-frequency APIs. Specifically, besides call interaction graph, MEGA considers another two new heterogeneous graphs: global API co-occurrence graph enriched with the API frequency information and hierarchical structure graph enriched with the project component information. With the three multi-view heterogeneous graphs, MEGA can capture the API usage patterns more accurately. Experiments on three Java benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA significantly outperforms the baseline models by at least 19% with respect to the Success Rate@1 metric. Especially, for the low-frequency APIs, MEGA also increases the baselines by at least 55% regarding the Success Rate@1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17234v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Learning (CL)-based recommender systems have gained prominence in the context of Heterogeneous Graph (HG) due to their capacity to enhance the consistency of representations across different views. However, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (e.g., brand preferences or demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |
| **[An Efficient Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation on Heterogeneous Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00216v1)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is an influx of heterogeneous information network (HIN) based recommender systems in recent years since HIN is capable of characterizing complex graphs and contains rich semantics. Although the existing approaches have achieved performance improvement, while practical, they still face the following problems. On one hand, most existing HIN-based methods rely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness between users and items, e.g., metapath-based similarities. These methods are hard to use and integrate since path connections are sparse or noisy, and are often of different lengths. On the other hand, other graph-based methods aim to learn effective heterogeneous network representations by compressing node together with its neighborhood information into single embedding before prediction. This weakly coupled manner in modeling overlooks the rich interactions among nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation (NIRec) to address the above problems. Specifically, we first analyze the significance of learning interactions in HINs and then propose a novel formulation to capture the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through their metapath-guided neighborhoods. Then, to explore complex interactions between metapaths and deal with the learning complexity on large-scale networks, we formulate interaction in a convolutional way and learn efficiently with fast Fourier transform. The extensive experiments on four different types of heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the performance gains of NIRec comparing with state-of-the-arts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing an efficient neighborhood-based interaction model in the HIN-based recommendations.</p></details> | KDD 2020 |
| **[Graph-based Recommendation for Sparse and Heterogeneous User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11009v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system research has oftentimes focused on approaches that operate on large-scale datasets containing millions of user interactions. However, many small businesses struggle to apply state-of-the-art models due to their very limited availability of data. We propose a graph-based recommender model which utilizes heterogeneous interactions between users and content of different types and is able to operate well on small-scale datasets. A genetic algorithm is used to find optimal weights that represent the strength of the relationship between users and content. Experiments on two real-world datasets (which we make available to the research community) show promising results (up to 7% improvement), in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods for low-data environments. These improvements are statistically significant and consistent across different data samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Explainable Recommendation over Academic Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07832v1)** | 2022-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of new graduates with research degrees every year, unprecedented challenges arise for early-career researchers to find a job at a suitable institution. This study aims to understand the behavior of academic job transition and hence recommend suitable institutions for PhD graduates. Specifically, we design a deep learning model to predict the career move of early-career researchers and provide suggestions. The design is built on top of scholarly/academic networks, which contains abundant information about scientific collaboration among scholars and institutions. We construct a heterogeneous scholarly network to facilitate the exploring of the behavior of career moves and the recommendation of institutions for scholars. We devise an unsupervised learning model called HAI (Heterogeneous graph Attention InfoMax) which aggregates attention mechanism and mutual information for institution recommendation. Moreover, we propose scholar attention and meta-path attention to discover the hidden relationships between several meta-paths. With these mechanisms, HAI provides ordered recommendations with explainability. We evaluate HAI upon a real-world dataset against baseline methods. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Beyond Prediction: On-street Parking Recommendation using Heterogeneous Graph-based List-wise Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.00162v2)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To provide real-time parking information, existing studies focus on predicting parking availability, which seems an indirect approach to saving drivers' cruising time. In this paper, we first time propose an on-street parking recommendation (OPR) task to directly recommend a parking space for a driver. To this end, a learn-to-rank (LTR) based OPR model called OPR-LTR is built. Specifically, parking recommendation is closely related to the "turnover events" (state switching between occupied and vacant) of each parking space, and hence we design a highly efficient heterogeneous graph called ESGraph to represent historical and real-time meters' turnover events as well as geographical relations; afterward, a convolution-based event-then-graph network is used to aggregate and update representations of the heterogeneous graph. A ranking model is further utilized to learn a score function that helps recommend a list of ranked parking spots for a specific on-street parking query. The method is verified using the on-street parking meter data in Hong Kong and San Francisco. By comparing with the other two types of methods: prediction-only and prediction-then-recommendation, the proposed direct-recommendation method achieves satisfactory performance in different metrics. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that the proposed ESGraph and the recommendation model are more efficient in terms of computational efficiency as well as saving drivers' on-street parking time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Privacy-preserving Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11730v4)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The heterogeneous information network (HIN), which contains rich semantics depicted by meta-paths, has emerged as a potent tool for mitigating data sparsity in recommender systems. Existing HIN-based recommender systems operate under the assumption of centralized storage and model training. However, real-world data is often distributed due to privacy concerns, leading to the semantic broken issue within HINs and consequent failures in centralized HIN-based recommendations. In this paper, we suggest the HIN is partitioned into private HINs stored on the client side and shared HINs on the server. Following this setting, we propose a federated heterogeneous graph neural network (FedHGNN) based framework, which facilitates collaborative training of a recommendation model using distributed HINs while protecting user privacy. Specifically, we first formalize the privacy definition for HIN-based federated recommendation (FedRec) in the light of differential privacy, with the goal of protecting user-item interactions within private HIN as well as users' high-order patterns from shared HINs. To recover the broken meta-path based semantics and ensure proposed privacy measures, we elaborately design a semantic-preserving user interactions publishing method, which locally perturbs user's high-order patterns and related user-item interactions for publishing. Subsequently, we introduce an HGNN model for recommendation, which conducts node- and semantic-level aggregations to capture recovered semantics. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods by a substantial margin (up to 34% in HR@10 and 42% in NDCG@10) under a reasonable privacy budget.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2024 |

To attract students' interest, the recommendation system is applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a course usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering some specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook students'interest to some specific knowledge concepts. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge concept recommendation. We propose an end-to-end graph neural network-based approach calledAttentionalHeterogeneous Graph Convolutional Deep Knowledge Recommender(ACKRec) for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs. Like other recommendation problems, it suffers from sparsity issues. To address this issue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn the representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to students and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g., courses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network to capture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types of entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process. Specifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students' preferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference distribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context information from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different interests of different students. The promising experiment results show that the proposedACKRecis able to effectively recommend knowledge concepts to students pursuing online learning in MOOCs.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous Information Network-based Interest Composition with Graph Neural Network for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06560v3)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are widely applied to recommendation systems due to their capability of modeling various auxiliary information with meta-paths. However, existing HIN-based recommendation models usually fuse the information from various meta-paths by simple weighted sum or concatenation, which limits performance improvement because it lacks the capability of interest compositions among meta-paths. In this article, we propose an HIN-based Interest Composition model for Recommendation (HicRec). Specifically, user and item representations are learned with a graph neural network on both the graph structure and features in each meta-path, and a parameter sharing mechanism is utilized here to ensure that the user and item representations are in the same latent space. Then, users' interests in each item from each pair of related meta-paths are calculated by a combination of the user and item representations. The composed user interests are obtained by their single interest from both intra- and inter-meta-paths for recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets and the results demonstrate that our proposed HicRec model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Graph Neural Networks-based micro-video recommendation has displayed performance improvement for many kinds of recommendation tasks. However, the existing works fail to fully consider the characteristics of micro-videos, such as the high timeliness of news nature micro-video recommendation and sequential interactions of frequently changed interests. In this paper, a novel Multi-aggregator Time-warping Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MTHGNN) is proposed for personalized news nature micro-video recommendation based on sequential sessions, where characteristics of micro-videos are comprehensively studied, users' preference is mined via multi-aggregator, the temporal and dynamic changes of users' preference are captured, and timeliness is considered. Through the comparison with the state-of-the-arts, the experimental results validate the superiority of our MTHGNN model.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging multi-domain data can improve recommendation systems by enriching user insights and mitigating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating such multi-domain knowledge for cross-domain recommendation remains challenging due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose HAGO, a novel framework with \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph co\textbf{O}rdinators, which dynamically integrates multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure. HAGO adaptively adjusts the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes to enhance beneficial inter-domain interactions while alleviating negative transfer. Furthermore, we introduce a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. Being compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, HAGO demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation scenarios, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

Unfortunately, because of language barrier, some scientists (especially the junior ones or graduate students who do not master other languages) cannot efficiently locate the publications hosted in a foreign language repository. In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent) information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm, the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the graph. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only outperform state-of-the-art baseline models, but also improve the interpretability of the representation model for cross-language citation recommendation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2018), 635--644</p></details> |

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Firzen: Firing Strict Cold-Start Items with Frozen Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Graphs for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07654v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation models utilizing unique identities (IDs) to represent distinct users and items have dominated the recommender systems literature for over a decade. Since multi-modal content of items (e.g., texts and images) and knowledge graphs (KGs) may reflect the interaction-related users' preferences and items' characteristics, they have been utilized as useful side information to further improve the recommendation quality. However, the success of such methods often limits to either warm-start or strict cold-start item recommendation in which some items neither appear in the training data nor have any interactions in the test stage: (1) Some fail to learn the embedding of a strict cold-start item since side information is only utilized to enhance the warm-start ID representations; (2) The others deteriorate the performance of warm-start recommendation since unrelated multi-modal content or entities in KGs may blur the final representations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework incorporating multi-modal content of items and KGs to effectively solve both strict cold-start and warm-start recommendation termed Firzen, which extracts the user-item collaborative information over frozen heterogeneous graph (collaborative knowledge graph), and exploits the item-item semantic structures and user-user behavioral association over frozen homogeneous graphs (item-item relation graph and user-user co-occurrence graph). Furthermore, we build four unified strict cold-start evaluation benchmarks based on publicly available Amazon datasets and a real-world industrial dataset from Weixin Channels via rearranging the interaction data and constructing KGs. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that our model yields significant improvements for strict cold-start recommendation and outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art performance in the warm-start scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024.

| **[HGCH: A Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network Model for Heterogeneous Collaborative Graph Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02961v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-item interaction data in collaborative filtering and graph modeling tasks often exhibit power-law characteristics, which suggest the suitability of hyperbolic space modeling. Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Neural Networks (HGCNs) are a novel technique that leverages the advantages of GCN and hyperbolic space, and then achieves remarkable results. However, existing HGCN methods have several drawbacks: they fail to fully leverage hyperbolic space properties due to arbitrary embedding initialization and imprecise tangent space aggregation; they overlook auxiliary information that could enrich the collaborative graph; and their training convergence is slow due to margin ranking loss and random negative sampling. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hyperbolic Graph Collaborative for Heterogeneous Recommendation (HGCH), an enhanced HGCN-based model for collaborative filtering that integrates diverse side information into a heterogeneous collaborative graph and improves training convergence speed. HGCH first preserves the long-tailed nature of the graph by initializing node embeddings with power law prior; then it aggregates neighbors in hyperbolic space using the gyromidpoint method for accurate computation; finally, it fuses multiple embeddings from different hyperbolic spaces by the gate fusion with prior. Moreover, HGCH employs a hyperbolic user-specific negative sampling to speed up convergence. We evaluate HGCH on four real datasets, and the results show that HGCH achieves competitive results and outperforms leading baselines, including HGCNs. Extensive ablation studies further confirm its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24)</p></details> |
| **[Poincaré Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11233v1)** | 2022-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) learns users' preferences by capturing the sequential patterns from users' behaviors evolution. As discussed in many works, user-item interactions of SR generally present the intrinsic power-law distribution, which can be ascended to hierarchy-like structures. Previous methods usually handle such hierarchical information by making user-item sectionalization empirically under Euclidean space, which may cause distortion of user-item representation in real online scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Poincaré-based heterogeneous graph neural network named PHGR to model the sequential pattern information as well as hierarchical information contained in the data of SR scenarios simultaneously. Specifically, for the purpose of explicitly capturing the hierarchical information, we first construct a weighted user-item heterogeneous graph by aliening all the user-item interactions to improve the perception domain of each user from a global view. Then the output of the global representation would be used to complement the local directed item-item homogeneous graph convolution. By defining a novel hyperbolic inner product operator, the global and local graph representation learning are directly conducted in Poincaré ball instead of commonly used projection operation between Poincaré ball and Euclidean space, which could alleviate the cumulative error issue of general bidirectional translation process. Moreover, for the purpose of explicitly capturing the sequential dependency information, we design two types of temporal attention operations under Poincaré ball space. Empirical evaluations on datasets from the public and financial industry show that PHGR outperforms several comparison methods.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figuews |
| **[IntentGC: a Scalable Graph Convolution Framework Fusing Heterogeneous Information for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12377v1)** | 2019-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of network embedding has led to state-of-the-art algorithms in recommendation. However, the sparsity of user-item interactions (i.e., explicit preferences) on websites remains a big challenge for predicting users' behaviors. Although research efforts have been made in utilizing some auxiliary information (e.g., social relations between users) to solve the problem, the existing rich heterogeneous auxiliary relationships are still not fully exploited. Moreover, previous works relied on linearly combined regularizers and suffered parameter tuning. In this work, we collect abundant relationships from common user behaviors and item information, and propose a novel framework named IntentGC to leverage both explicit preferences and heterogeneous relationships by graph convolutional networks. In addition to the capability of modeling heterogeneity, IntentGC can learn the importance of different relationships automatically by the neural model in a nonlinear sense. To apply IntentGC to web-scale applications, we design a faster graph convolutional model named IntentNet by avoiding unnecessary feature interactions. Empirical experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets and online A/B tests in Alibaba demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | KDD2019 |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph-based Framework with Disentangled Representations Learning for Multi-target Cross Domain Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00909v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CDR (Cross-Domain Recommendation), i.e., leveraging information from multiple domains, is a critical solution to data sparsity problem in recommendation system. The majority of previous research either focused on single-target CDR (STCDR) by utilizing data from the source domains to improve the model's performance on the target domain, or applied dual-target CDR (DTCDR) by integrating data from the source and target domains. In addition, multi-target CDR (MTCDR) is a generalization of DTCDR, which is able to capture the link among different domains. In this paper we present HGDR (Heterogeneous Graph-based Framework with Disentangled Representations Learning), an end-to-end heterogeneous network architecture where graph convolutional layers are applied to model relations among different domains, meanwhile utilizes the idea of disentangling representation for domain-shared and domain-specifc information. First, a shared heterogeneous graph is generated by gathering users and items from several domains without any further side information. Second, we use HGDR to compute disentangled representations for users and items in all domains. Experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests prove that our proposed model can transmit information among domains effectively and reach the SOTA performance.

The intent of a shopping basket can be retrieved from both user-item collaborative filtering signals and multi-item correlations. By defining a basket entity to represent the basket intent, we can model this problem as a basket-item link prediction task in the User-Basket-Item~(UBI) graph. Previous work solves the problem by leveraging user-item interactions and item-item interactions simultaneously. However, collectivity and heterogeneity characteristics are hardly investigated before. Collectivity defines the semantics of each node which should be aggregated from both directly and indirectly connected neighbors. Heterogeneity comes from multi-type interactions as well as multi-type nodes in the UBI graph. To this end, we propose a new framework named \textbf{BasConv}, which is based on the graph convolutional neural network. Our BasConv model has three types of aggregators specifically designed for three types of nodes. They collectively learn node embeddings from both neighborhood and high-order context. Additionally, the interactive layers in the aggregators can distinguish different types of interactions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of BasConv.

| **[SLIF-MR: Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09998v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) and multimodal item information, which respectively capture relational and attribute features, play a crucial role in improving recommender system accuracy. Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |

Graph Neural Network (GNN), which can generate high-quality embeddings by capturing graph-structured information, is convenient for the recommendation. However, most existing GNN models mainly focus on the homogeneous graph. They cannot characterize heterogeneous and complex data in the recommendation system. Meanwhile, it is challenging to develop effective methods to mine the heterogeneity and latent correlations in the graph. In this paper, we adopt Heterogeneous Attributed Network (HAN), which involves different node types as well as rich node attributes, to model data in the recommendation system. Furthermore, we propose a novel graph neural network-based model to deal with HAN for Recommendation, called HANRec. In particular, we design a component connecting potential neighbors to explore the influence between neighbors and provide two different strategies with the attention mechanism to aggregate neighbors' information. The experimental results on two real-world datasets prove that HANRec outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we review the development of recommendation frameworks with the focus on heterogeneous relational learning, which consists of different types of dependencies among users and items. The objective of this task is to map heterogeneous relational data into latent representation space, such that the structural and relational properties from both user and item domain can be well preserved. To address this problem, recent research developments can fall into three major lines: social recommendation, knowledge graph-enhanced recommender system, and multi-behavior recommendation. We discuss the learning approaches in each category, such as matrix factorization, attention mechanism and graph neural networks, for effectively distilling heterogeneous contextual information. Finally, we present an exploratory outlook to highlight several promising directions and opportunities in heterogeneous relational learning frameworks for recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a paper in IJCAI 2021</p></details> |

However, there remains a noticeable dearth of research on their seamless integration among heterogeneous recommender systems, despite knowledge graph-based recommender systems garnering extensive research attention. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing RecKG, a standardized knowledge graph for recommender systems. RecKG ensures the consistent representation of entities across different datasets, accommodating diverse attribute types for effective data integration. Through a meticulous examination of various recommender system datasets, we select attributes for RecKG, ensuring standardized formatting through consistent naming conventions. By these characteristics, RecKG can seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the discovery of additional semantic information within the integrated knowledge graph. We apply RecKG to standardize real-world datasets, subsequently developing an application for RecKG using a graph database. Finally, we validate RecKG's achievement in interoperability through a qualitative evaluation between RecKG and other studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 39th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing(SAC) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Behavior Enhanced Recommendation with Cross-Interaction Collaborative Relation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02307v1)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many previous studies aim to augment collaborative filtering with deep neural network techniques, so as to achieve better recommendation performance. However, most existing deep learning-based recommender systems are designed for modeling singular type of user-item interaction behavior, which can hardly distill the heterogeneous relations between user and item. In practical recommendation scenarios, there exist multityped user behaviors, such as browse and purchase. Due to the overlook of user's multi-behavioral patterns over different items, existing recommendation methods are insufficient to capture heterogeneous collaborative signals from user multi-behavior data. Inspired by the strength of graph neural networks for structured data modeling, this work proposes a Graph Neural Multi-Behavior Enhanced Recommendation (GNMR) framework which explicitly models the dependencies between different types of user-item interactions under a graph-based message passing architecture. GNMR devises a relation aggregation network to model interaction heterogeneity, and recursively performs embedding propagation between neighboring nodes over the user-item interaction graph. Experiments on real-world recommendation datasets show that our GNMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[TEA: A Sequential Recommendation Framework via Temporally Evolving Aggregations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07378v2)** | 2022-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to choose the most suitable items for a user at a specific timestamp given historical behaviors. Existing methods usually model the user behavior sequence based on the transition-based methods like Markov Chain. However, these methods also implicitly assume that the users are independent of each other without considering the influence between users. In fact, this influence plays an important role in sequence recommendation since the behavior of a user is easily affected by others. Therefore, it is desirable to aggregate both user behaviors and the influence between users, which are evolved temporally and involved in the heterogeneous graph of users and items. In this paper, we incorporate dynamic user-item heterogeneous graphs to propose a novel sequential recommendation framework. As a result, the historical behaviors as well as the influence between users can be taken into consideration. To achieve this, we firstly formalize sequential recommendation as a problem to estimate conditional probability given temporal dynamic heterogeneous graphs and user behavior sequences. After that, we exploit the conditional random field to aggregate the heterogeneous graphs and user behaviors for probability estimation, and employ the pseudo-likelihood approach to derive a tractable objective function. Finally, we provide scalable and flexible implementations of the proposed framework. Experimental results on three real-world datasets not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method but also provide some insightful discoveries on sequential recommendation.</p></details> |  |

This is a recommendation task with two queries, a.k.a. user ID and keyword. However, existing methods focus on recommendation according to one query, a.k.a. user ID, and are not applicable to solving this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel click-through rate (CTR) prediction model with heterogeneous graph neural network, called AMinerGNN, to recommend papers with two queries. Specifically, AMinerGNN constructs a heterogeneous graph to project user, paper, and keyword into the same embedding space by graph representation learning. To process two queries, a novel query attentive fusion layer is designed to recognize their importances dynamically and then fuse them as one query to build a unified and end-to-end recommender system. Experimental results on our proposed dataset and online A/B tests prove the superiority of AMinerGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07243v2)** | 2019-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can naturally integrate node information and topological structure, have been demonstrated to be powerful in learning on graph data. These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths.

Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks (GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced RecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1) treat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the highly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to explicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich knowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of meta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs. This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user representations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the state-of-the-art baselines on both regular and cold-start recommendation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages accepted by IEEE BigData</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Optimal SDG Pathways: An Innovative Approach Leveraging Graph Pruning and Intent Graph for Effective Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11741v1)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recommendation of appropriate development pathways, also known as ecological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for promoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a specific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully consider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic characteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data, which limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development patterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue of spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we construct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures the preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN, KGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-aware Cross-school Electives Recommendation: a Hybrid Federated Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12202v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of modern education, addressing cross-school learner diversity is crucial, especially in personalized recommender systems for elective course selection. However, privacy concerns often limit cross-school data sharing, which hinders existing methods' ability to model sparse data and address heterogeneity effectively, ultimately leading to suboptimal recommendations. In response, we propose HFRec, a heterogeneity-aware hybrid federated recommender system designed for cross-school elective course recommendations. The proposed model constructs heterogeneous graphs for each school, incorporating various interactions and historical behaviors between students to integrate context and content information. We design an attention mechanism to capture heterogeneity-aware representations. Moreover, under a federated scheme, we train individual school-based models with adaptive learning settings to recommend tailored electives. Our HFRec model demonstrates its effectiveness in providing personalized elective recommendations while maintaining privacy, as it outperforms state-of-the-art models on both open-source and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03665v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage their auxiliary information. The core idea of KG-enhanced recommenders is to incorporate rich semantic information for more accurate recommendations. However, two main challenges persist: i) Neglecting complex higher-order interactions in the KG-based user-item network, potentially leading to sub-optimal recommendations, and ii) Dealing with the heterogeneous modalities of input sources, such as user-item bipartite graphs and KGs, which may introduce noise and inaccuracies. To address these issues, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced Heterogeneous Hypergraph Recommender System (KHGRec). KHGRec captures group-wise characteristics of both the interaction network and the KG, modeling complex connections in the KG. Using a collaborative knowledge heterogeneous hypergraph (CKHG), it employs two hypergraph encoders to model group-wise interdependencies and ensure explainability. Additionally, it fuses signals from the input graphs with cross-view self-supervised learning and attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our model's superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines, with an average 5.18\% relative improvement. Additional tests on noise resilience, missing data, and cold-start problems demonstrate the robustness of our KHGRec framework.

| **[Improving Accuracy and Diversity in Matching of Recommendation with Diversified Preference Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03787v1)** | 2021-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, real-world recommendation systems need to deal with millions of candidates. It is extremely challenging to conduct sophisticated end-to-end algorithms on the entire corpus due to the tremendous computation costs. Therefore, conventional recommendation systems usually contain two modules. The matching module focuses on the coverage, which aims to efficiently retrieve hundreds of items from large corpora, while the ranking module generates specific ranks for these items. Recommendation diversity is an essential factor that impacts user experience. Most efforts have explored recommendation diversity in ranking, while the matching module should take more responsibility for diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph neural network framework for diversified recommendation (GraphDR) in matching to improve both recommendation accuracy and diversity. Specifically, GraphDR builds a huge heterogeneous preference network to record different types of user preferences, and conduct a field-level heterogeneous graph attention network for node aggregation. We also innovatively conduct a neighbor-similarity based loss to balance both recommendation accuracy and diversity for the diversified matching task. In experiments, we conduct extensive online and offline evaluations on a real-world recommendation system with various accuracy and diversity metrics and achieve significant improvements. We also conduct model analyses and case study for a better understanding of our model. Moreover, GraphDR has been deployed on a well-known recommendation system, which affects millions of users.

Despite the significant progress made by existing solutions, we argue that current methods fall short in two limitations: (1) Existing social-aware recommendation models only consider collaborative similarity between items, how to incorporate item-wise semantic relatedness is less explored in current recommendation paradigms. (2) Current social recommender systems neglect the entanglement of the latent factors over heterogeneous relations (e.g., social connections, user-item interactions). Learning the disentangled representations with relation heterogeneity poses great challenge for social recommendation. In this work, we design a Disentangled Graph Neural Network (DGNN) with the integration of latent memory units, which empowers DGNN to maintain factorized representations for heterogeneous types of user and item connections. Additionally, we devise new memory-augmented message propagation and aggregation schemes under the graph neural architecture, allowing us to recursively distill semantic relatedness into the representations of users and items in a fully automatic manner. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our model by achieving great improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

Dynamically adding collaborative signals from neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied, the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware) embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning (such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Pre-Training Heterogeneous Subgraph Transformer for Top-$N$ Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06722v1)** | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity, heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been adopted to characterize complex and heterogeneous auxiliary data in top-$N$ recommender systems, called \emph{HIN-based recommendation}. HIN characterizes complex, heterogeneous data relations, containing a variety of information that may not be related to the recommendation task. Therefore, it is challenging to effectively leverage useful information from HINs for improving the recommendation performance. To address the above issue, we propose a Curriculum pre-training based HEterogeneous Subgraph Transformer (called \emph{CHEST}) with new \emph{data characterization}, \emph{representation model} and \emph{learning algorithm}. Specifically, we consider extracting useful information from HIN to compose the interaction-specific heterogeneous subgraph, containing both sufficient and relevant context information for recommendation. Then we capture the rich semantics (\eg graph structure and path semantics) within the subgraph via a heterogeneous subgraph Transformer, where we encode the subgraph with multi-slot sequence representations. Besides, we design a curriculum pre-training strategy to provide an elementary-to-advanced learning process, by which we smoothly transfer basic semantics in HIN for modeling user-item interaction relation. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over a number of competitive baselines, especially when only limited training data is available.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied in this problem and achieve superior performance, existing methods underexplore the graph-level GNN methods, which exhibit great potential in traditional recommender system. Furthermore, they usually lack the transferability from one domain with sufficient supervision to another domain which might suffer from the label scarcity issue. In this work, we propose a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network model, SUGER, for bundle recommendation to handle these limitations. SUGER generates heterogeneous subgraphs around the user-bundle pairs, and then maps those subgraphs to the users' preference predictions via neural relational graph propagation. Experimental results show that SUGER significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both the basic and the transfer bundle recommendation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privileged Graph Distillation for Cold Start Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14975v1)** | 2021-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cold start problem in recommender systems is a long-standing challenge, which requires recommending to new users (items) based on attributes without any historical interaction records. In these recommendation systems, warm users (items) have privileged collaborative signals of interaction records compared to cold start users (items), and these Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals are shown to have competing performance for recommendation. Many researchers proposed to learn the correlation between collaborative signal embedding space and the attribute embedding space to improve the cold start recommendation, in which user and item categorical attributes are available in many online platforms. However, the cold start recommendation is still limited by two embedding spaces modeling and simple assumptions of space transformation. As user-item interaction behaviors and user (item) attributes naturally form a heterogeneous graph structure, in this paper, we propose a privileged graph distillation model~(PGD). The teacher model is composed of a heterogeneous graph structure for warm users and items with privileged CF links. The student model is composed of an entity-attribute graph without CF links. Specifically, the teacher model can learn better embeddings of each entity by injecting complex higher-order relationships from the constructed heterogeneous graph. The student model can learn the distilled output with privileged CF embeddings from the teacher embeddings. Our proposed model is generally applicable to different cold start scenarios with new user, new item, or new user-new item. Finally, extensive experimental results on the real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on different types of cold start problems, with average $6.6\%, 5.6\%, $ and $17.1\%$ improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on three datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages,5 figures |
| **[Predictive and Contrastive: Dual-Auxiliary Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03982v2)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) recently has achieved outstanding success on recommendation. By setting up an auxiliary task (either predictive or contrastive), SSL can discover supervisory signals from the raw data without human annotation, which greatly mitigates the problem of sparse user-item interactions. However, most SSL-based recommendation models rely on general-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node representations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs, which are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the rich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie in the recommendation data-based heterogeneous graphs, are not fully exploited. To explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively analyze the heterogeneous interaction data and find a strong positive correlation between the interactions and the number of user-item paths induced by meta-paths. Based on the finding, we design two auxiliary tasks that are tightly coupled with the target task (one is predictive and the other one is contrastive) towards connecting recommendation with the self-supervision signals hiding in the positive correlation. Finally, a model-agnostic DUal-Auxiliary Learning (DUAL) framework which unifies the SSL and recommendation tasks is developed. The extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DUAL can significantly improve recommendation, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Domain Adaptation for Item-to-Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03191v1)** | 2023-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation is an important function in most recommendation systems, which generates replacement or complement suggestions for a particular item based on its semantic similarities to other cataloged items. Given that subsets of items in a recommendation system might be co-interacted with by the same set of customers, graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), provide a natural framework to combine, ingest and extract valuable insights from such high-order relational interactions between cataloged items, as well as their metadata features, as has been shown in many recent studies. However, learning GNNs effectively for I2I requires ingesting a large amount of relational data, which might not always be available, especially in new, emerging market segments. To mitigate this data bottleneck, we postulate that recommendation patterns learned from existing mature market segments (with private data) could be adapted to build effective warm-start models for emerging ones. To achieve this, we propose and investigate a personalized federated modeling framework based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across market segments with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models. Our key contribution is a personalized graph adaptation model that bridges the gap between recent literature on federated GNNs and (non-graph) personalized federated learning, which either does not optimize for the adaptability of the federated model or is restricted to local models with homogeneous parameterization, excluding GNNs with heterogeneous local graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by UAI 2023</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Graph-Based Behavior-Aware Recommendation for Interactive News](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00002v2)** | 2021-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive news recommendation has been launched and attracted much attention recently. In this scenario, user's behavior evolves from single click behavior to multiple behaviors including like, comment, share etc. However, most of the existing methods still use single click behavior as the unique criterion of judging user's preferences. Further, although heterogeneous graphs have been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous graph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is still desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based behavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of behaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity. We have three main steps. First, we build an interaction behavior graph for multi-level and multi-category data. Second, we apply DeepWalk on the behavior graph to obtain entity semantics, then build a graph-based convolutional neural network called G-CNN to learn news representations, and an attention-based LSTM to learn behavior sequence representations. Third, we introduce core and coritivity features for the behavior graph, which measure the concentration degree of user's interests. These features affect the trade-off between accuracy and diversity of our personalized recommendation system. Taking these features into account, our system finally achieves recommending news to different users at their different levels of concentration degrees.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Bridging RDF Knowledge Graphs with Graph Neural Networks for Semantically-Rich Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08743v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-Aware Generative Next POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12350v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2) previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation). Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG) format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure, thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-aware Tensor Decomposition for Meta-graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01078v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs generally refers to graphs with different types of nodes and edges. A common approach for extracting useful information from heterogeneous graphs is to use meta-graphs, which can be seen as a special kind of directed acyclic graph (DAG) with same node and edge types as the heterogeneous graph. However, how to design proper meta-graphs is challenging. Recently, there have been many works on learning suitable meta-graphs from a heterogeneous graph. Existing methods generally introduce continuous weights for edges that are independent of each other, which ignores the topological stucture of meta-graphs and can be ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a new viewpoint from tensor on learning meta-graphs. Such a viewpoint not only helps interpret the limitation of existing works by CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, but also inspires us to propose a topology-aware tensor decomposition, called TENSUS, that reflects the structure of DAGs. The proposed topology-aware tensor decomposition is easy to use and simple to implement, and it can be taken as a plug-in part to upgrade many existing works, including node classification and recommendation on heterogeneous graphs. Experimental results on different tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the state-of-the-arts for all these tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMR: Medical Knowledge Graph Embedding for Safe Medicine Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05980v3)** | 2020-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the existing medicine recommendation systems that are mainly based on electronic medical records (EMRs) are significantly assisting doctors to make better clinical decisions benefiting both patients and caregivers. Even though the growth of EMRs is at a lighting fast speed in the era of big data, content limitations in EMRs restrain the existed recommendation systems to reflect relevant medical facts, such as drug-drug interactions. Many medical knowledge graphs that contain drug-related information, such as DrugBank, may give hope for the recommendation systems. However, the direct use of these knowledge graphs in the systems suffers from robustness caused by the incompleteness of the graphs. To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in graph embedding learning techniques and propose a novel framework, called Safe Medicine Recommendation (SMR), in this paper. Specifically, SMR first constructs a high-quality heterogeneous graph by bridging EMRs (MIMIC-III) and medical knowledge graphs (ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank). Then, SMR jointly embeds diseases, medicines, patients, and their corresponding relations into a shared lower dimensional space. Finally, SMR uses the embeddings to decompose the medicine recommendation into a link prediction process while considering the patient's diagnoses and adverse drug reactions. To our best knowledge, SMR is the first to learn embeddings of a patient-disease-medicine graph for medicine recommendation in the world. Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing NBR models often overlook a crucial factor, which is price, and do not fully capture item-basket-user interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Basket-augmented Dynamic Heterogeneous Hypergraph (BDHH). BDHH utilizes a heterogeneous multi-relational graph to capture the intricate relationships among item features, with price as a critical factor. Moreover, our approach includes a basket-guided dynamic augmentation network that could dynamically enhances item-basket-user interactions. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BDHH significantly improves recommendation accuracy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Generation: A Hierarchical Approach using Node Feature Pooling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11972v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs are present in various domains, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and biological networks. Unlike homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs consist of multiple types of nodes and edges, each representing different entities and relationships. Generating realistic heterogeneous graphs that capture the complex interactions among diverse entities is a difficult task due to several reasons. The generator has to model both the node type distribution along with the feature distribution for each node type. In this paper, we look into solving challenges in heterogeneous graph generation, by employing a two phase hierarchical structure, wherein the first phase creates a skeleton graph with node types using a prior diffusion based model and in the second phase, we use an encoder and a sampler structure as generator to assign node type specific features to the nodes. A discriminator is used to guide training of the generator and feature vectors are sampled from a node feature pool. We conduct extensive experiments with subsets of IMDB and DBLP datasets to show the effectiveness of our method and also the need for various architecture components.</p></details> |  |

GLRS mainly employ the advanced graph learning approaches to model users' preferences and intentions as well as items' characteristics and popularity for Recommender Systems (RS). Differently from conventional RS, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on simple or complex graphs where various objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising direction for building advanced RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, on how they obtain the knowledge from graphs to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability for recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges in this new research area. Then, we survey the most recent and important developments in the area. Finally, we share some new research directions in this vibrant area.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically assume static graphs, while real-world graphs are continuously evolving. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work introduces HERO (HEterogeneous continual gRaph learning via meta-knOwledge distillation), a unified framework for continual learning on heterogeneous graphs. HERO employs meta-adaptation, a gradient-based meta-learning strategy that provides directional guidance for rapid adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. To enable efficient and effective knowledge reuse, we propose DiSCo (Diversity Sampling with semantic Consistency), a heterogeneity-aware sampling method that maximizes target node diversity and expands subgraphs along metapaths, retaining critical semantic and structural information with minimal overhead. Furthermore, HERO incorporates heterogeneity-aware knowledge distillation, which aligns knowledge at both the node and semantic levels to balance adaptation and retention across tasks. Extensive experiments on four web-related heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrate that HERO substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving efficient and consistent knowledge reuse in dynamic web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated version with new LaTeX template and minor formatting revisions, added references and experimental results</p></details> |

Many online services provide social networks among users, and it is crucial to utilize social information since recommendation by a friend is more likely to grab attention than the one from a random user. Also, explaining why items are recommended is very important in encouraging the users' actions such as actual purchases. Exploiting both ratings and social graph for recommendation, however, is not trivial because of the heterogeneity of the data. In this paper, we propose UniWalk, an explainable and accurate recommender system that exploits both social network and rating data. UniWalk combines both data into a unified graph, learns latent features of users and items, and recommends items to each user through the features. Importantly, it explains why items are recommended together with the recommendation results. Extensive experiments show that UniWalk provides the best explainability and achieves the state-of-the-art-accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Rich-Item Recommendations for Rich-Users: Exploiting Dynamic and Static Side Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10495v2)** | 2020-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the problem of recommendation system where the users and items to be recommended are rich data structures with multiple entity types and with multiple sources of side-information in the form of graphs. We provide a general formulation for the problem that captures the complexities of modern real-world recommendations and generalizes many existing formulations. In our formulation, each user/document that requires a recommendation and each item or tag that is to be recommended, both are modeled by a set of static entities and a dynamic component. The relationships between entities are captured by several weighted bipartite graphs. To effectively exploit these complex interactions and learn the recommendation model, we propose MEDRES- a multiple graph-CNN based novel deep-learning architecture. MEDRES uses AL-GCN, a novel graph convolution network block, that harnesses strong representative features from the underlying graphs. Moreover, in order to capture highly heterogeneous engagement of different users with the system and constraints on the number of items to be recommended, we propose a novel ranking metric pAp@k along with a method to optimize the metric directly. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method on two benchmarks: a) citation data, b) Flickr data. In addition, we present two real-world case studies of our formulation and the MEDRES architecture. We show how our technique can be used to naturally model the message recommendation problem and the teams recommendation problem in the Microsoft Teams (MSTeams) product and demonstrate that it is 5-6% points more accurate than the production-grade models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally. 21 pages, 8 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

It can help people from the preparation of ingredients, food cooking process, etc. to prepare the food, and increasingly in demand on the Web. To help users find the vast amount of recipes on the Web, we address the task of recipe recommendation. Due to multiple data types and relationships in a recipe, we can treat it as a heterogeneous network to describe its information more accurately. To effectively utilize the heterogeneous network, metapath was proposed to describe the higher-level semantic information between two entities by defining a compound path from peer entities. Therefore, we propose a metapath-enhanced recipe recommendation framework, RecipeMeta, that combines GNN (Graph Neural Network)-based representation learning and specific metapath-based information in a recipe to predict User-Recipe pairs for recommendation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model, RecipeMeta, outperforms state-of-the-art methods for recipe recommendation.</p></details> |  |

As a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs, relevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of different types, which has been used in many applications such as web search, recommendation, and community detection. Most of existing relevance measures focus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few measures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the pre-defined meta-path. Defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. Recently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been applied for measuring relevance yet. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel GNN-based relevance measure, namely GSim. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze and show that GNN is effective for measuring the relevance of nodes in the graph. We then propose a context path-based graph neural network (CP-GNN) to automatically leverage the semantics in heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, we exploit CP-GNN to support relevance measures between two objects of any type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSim outperforms existing measures.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |

Via unifying the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of users and items with rich semantics. However, these real-world tripartite graphs are usually scale-free, the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures of which are underemphasized in existing works, consequently, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue and provide more accurate recommendation, we propose a knowledge-aware recommendation method with the hyperbolic geometry, namely Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation (LKGR). LKGR facilitates better modeling of scale-free tripartite graphs after the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous information from historical interactions and KGs. Our proposed knowledge-aware attention mechanism enables the model to automatically measure the information contribution, producing the coherent information aggregation in the hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LKGR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.6-15.3% of Recall@20 on Top-K recommendation.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the overlook of inter-dependent knowledge across items (e.g., categories of products), existing social recommender systems are insufficient to distill the heterogeneous collaborative signals from both user and item sides. In this work, we propose a Self-Supervised Metagraph Infor-max Network (SMIN) which investigates the potential of jointly incorporating social- and knowledge-aware relational structures into the user preference representation for recommendation. To model relation heterogeneity, we design a metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network to aggregate feature embeddings from different types of meta-relations across users and items, em-powering SMIN to maintain dedicated representations for multi-faceted user- and item-wise dependencies. Additionally, to inject high-order collaborative signals, we generalize the mutual information learning paradigm under the self-supervised graph-based collaborative filtering. This endows the expressive modeling of user-item interactive patterns, by exploring global-level collaborative relations and underlying isomorphic transformation property of graph topology. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SMIN model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

Leveraging these data, various doctor recommendation systems have been proposed. Typically, such studies process the EHR data in a flat-structured manner, where each encounter was treated as an unordered set of features. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous structured information such as service sequence stored in claims shall not be ignored. This paper presents a doctor recommendation system with time embedding to reconstruct the potential connections between patients and doctors using heterogeneous graph attention network. Besides, to address the privacy issue of patient data sharing crossing hospitals, a federated decentralized learning method based on a minimization optimization model is also proposed. The graph-based recommendation system has been validated on a EHR dataset. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method improves the AUC by up to 6.2%. And our proposed federated-based algorithm not only yields the fictitious fusion center's performance but also enjoys a convergence rate of O(1/T).</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, GRank neglects the semantics behind different types of paths in the network and during the process, it may use unreliable paths that are inconsistent with the general idea of similarity in neighborhood collaborative ranking. That negligence undermines the reliability of the recommendation list generated by GRank. This paper seeks to present a novel framework for reliable graph-based collaborative ranking, called ReGRank, that ranks items based on reliable recommendation paths that are in harmony with the semantics behind different approaches in neighborhood collaborative ranking. To our knowledge, ReGRank is the first unified framework for neighborhood collaborative ranking that in addition to traditional user-based collaborative ranking, can also be adapted for preference-based and representative-based collaborative ranking as well. Experimental results show that ReGRank significantly improves the state-of-the art neighborhood and graph-based collaborative ranking algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

To tackle this, the pre-training mechanism has been widely adopted, which attempts to leverage large-scale data to perform self-supervised learning and transfer the pre-trained parameters to downstream tasks. However, previous pre-trained models for recommendation focus on leverage universal sequence patterns from user behaviour sequences and item information, whereas ignore capturing personalized interests with the heterogeneous user information, which has been shown effective in contributing to personalized recommendation. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance pre-trained models with heterogeneous user information, called User-aware Pre-training for Recommendation (UPRec). Specifically, UPRec leverages the user attributes andstructured social graphs to construct self-supervised objectives in the pre-training stage and proposes two user-aware pre-training tasks. Comprehensive experimental results on several real-world large-scale recommendation datasets demonstrate that UPRec can effectively integrate user information into pre-trained models and thus provide more appropriate recommendations for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

Proper explanations for the model behavior increase model transparency and help researchers develop more accountable models. Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently shown superior performance in many graph ML problems than traditional methods, and explaining them has attracted increased interest. However, GNN explanation for link prediction (LP) is lacking in the literature. LP is an essential GNN task and corresponds to web applications like recommendation and sponsored search on web. Given existing GNN explanation methods only address node/graph-level tasks, we propose Path-based GNN Explanation for heterogeneous Link prediction (PaGE-Link) that generates explanations with connection interpretability, enjoys model scalability, and handles graph heterogeneity. Qualitatively, PaGE-Link can generate explanations as paths connecting a node pair, which naturally captures connections between the two nodes and easily transfer to human-interpretable explanations. Quantitatively, explanations generated by PaGE-Link improve AUC for recommendation on citation and user-item graphs by 9 - 35% and are chosen as better by 78.79% of responses in human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Relational Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01103v3)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized recommender systems play a crucial role in capturing users' evolving preferences over time to provide accurate and effective recommendations on various online platforms. However, many recommendation models rely on a single type of behavior learning, which limits their ability to represent the complex relationships between users and items in real-life scenarios. In such situations, users interact with items in multiple ways, including clicking, tagging as favorite, reviewing, and purchasing. To address this issue, we propose the Relation-aware Contrastive Learning (RCL) framework, which effectively models dynamic interaction heterogeneity. The RCL model incorporates a multi-relational graph encoder that captures short-term preference heterogeneity while preserving the dedicated relation semantics for different types of user-item interactions. Moreover, we design a dynamic cross-relational memory network that enables the RCL model to capture users' long-term multi-behavior preferences and the underlying evolving cross-type behavior dependencies over time. To obtain robust and informative user representations with both commonality and diversity across multi-behavior interactions, we introduce a multi-relational contrastive learning paradigm with heterogeneous short- and long-term interest modeling. Our extensive experimental studies on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the RCL recommender system over various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published as a full paper at RecSys 2023</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05029v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research on Personalized Financial Product Recommendation by Integrating Large Language Models and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05873v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users' latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings. Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIARec: Mutual-influence-aware Heterogeneous Network Embedding for Scientific Paper Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12054v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific paper recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Privacy-Preserving Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00538v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are considered to be heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) with deep learning technological advances. HGNNs, compared to homogeneous data, absorb various aspects of information about individuals in the training stage. That means more information has been covered in the learning result, especially sensitive information. However, the privacy-preserving methods on homogeneous graphs only preserve the same type of node attributes or relationships, which cannot effectively work on heterogeneous graphs due to the complexity. To address this issue, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network privacy-preserving method based on a differential privacy mechanism named HeteDP, which provides a double guarantee on graph features and topology. In particular, we first define a new attack scheme to reveal privacy leakage in the heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we design a two-stage pipeline framework, which includes the privacy-preserving feature encoder and the heterogeneous link reconstructor with gradients perturbation based on differential privacy to tolerate data diversity and against the attack. To better control the noise and promote model performance, we utilize a bi-level optimization pattern to allocate a suitable privacy budget for the above two modules. Our experiments on four public benchmarks show that the HeteDP method is equipped to resist heterogeneous graph privacy leakage with admirable model generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are still trained on all the data available, requiring multiple days to train a single model, without counting hyperparameter tuning. In this work we focus on graph-based recommender systems, i.e., systems that model the data as a heterogeneous network. In other applications, graph sampling allows to study a subgraph and generalize the findings to the original graph. Thus, we investigate the applicability of sampling techniques for this task. We test on three real world datasets, with three state-of-the-art inductive methods, and using six different sampling methods. We find that its possible to maintain performance using only 50% of the training data with up to 86% percent decrease in training time; however, using less training data leads to far worse performance. Further, we find that when it comes to data for recommendations, graph sampling should also account for the temporal dimension. Therefore, we find that if higher data reduction is needed, new graph based sampling techniques should be studied and new inductive methods should be designed.</p></details> |  |

However, data sparsity is still a challenging problem that most graph-based recommendation methods are confronted with. Recent works try to address this problem by utilizing side information. In this paper, we exploit the relevant and easily accessible textual information by advanced natural language processing (NLP) models and propose a light RGCN-based (RGCN, relational graph convolutional network) collaborative filtering method on heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, to incorporate rich textual knowledge, we utilize a pre-trained NLP model to initialize the embeddings of text nodes. Afterward, by performing a simplified RGCN-based node information propagation on the constructed heterogeneous graph, the embeddings of users and items can be adjusted with textual knowledge, which effectively alleviates the negative effects of data sparsity. Moreover, the matching function used by most graph-based representation learning methods is the inner product, which is not appropriate for the obtained embeddings that contain complex semantics. We design a predictive network that combines graph-based representation learning with neural matching function learning, and demonstrate that this architecture can bring a significant performance improvement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, and the results verify the superior performance of our method over several baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Dyadic Relations with Homogeneous Graphs for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12097v3)** | 2023-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User interaction data in recommender systems is a form of dyadic relation that reflects the preferences of users with items. Learning the representations of these two discrete sets of objects, users and items, is critical for recommendation. Recent multimodal recommendation models leveraging multimodal features (e.g., images and text descriptions) have been demonstrated to be effective in improving recommendation accuracy. However, state-of-the-art models enhance the dyadic relations between users and items by considering either user-user or item-item relations, leaving the high-order relations of the other side (i.e., users or items) unexplored. Furthermore, we experimentally reveal that the current multimodality fusion methods in the state-of-the-art models may degrade their recommendation performance. That is, without tainting the model architectures, these models can achieve even better recommendation accuracy with uni-modal information. On top of the finding, we propose a model that enhances the dyadic relations by learning Dual RepresentAtions of both users and items via constructing homogeneous Graphs for multimOdal recommeNdation. We name our model as DRAGON. Specifically, DRAGON constructs the user-user graph based on the commonly interacted items and the item-item graph from item multimodal features. It then utilizes graph learning on both the user-item heterogeneous graph and the homogeneous graphs (user-user and item-item) to obtain the dual representations of users and items. To capture information from each modality, DRAGON employs a simple yet effective fusion method, attentive concatenation, to derive the representations of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and seven baselines show that DRAGON can outperform the strongest baseline by 22.03% on average. Various ablation studies are conducted on DRAGON to validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

The proposed model is based on the fact that heterogeneous learning tasks, which correspond to different generative processes, often rely on data with a shared graph structure. Accordingly, our model combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) with multiple variational autoencoders, thus embedding the nodes of the graph i.e., samples for the tasks) in a uniform manner while specializing their organization and usage to different tasks. With a focus on healthcare applications (tasks), including clinical topic modeling, procedure recommendation and admission-type prediction, we demonstrate that our method successfully leverages information across different tasks, boosting performance in all tasks and outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-2020</p></details> |

Although different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to dynamic graphs, most of them only support homogeneous graphs or suffer from model design heavily influenced by specific THNs prediction tasks. Furthermore, there is a lack of temporal heterogeneous networked data in current standard graph benchmark datasets. Hence, in this work, we propose DURENDAL, a graph deep learning framework for THNs. DURENDAL can help to easily repurpose any heterogeneous graph learning model to evolving networks by combining design principles from snapshot-based and multirelational message-passing graph learning models. We introduce two different schemes to update embedding representations for THNs, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of both strategies. We also extend the set of benchmarks for TNHs by introducing two novel high-resolution temporal heterogeneous graph datasets derived from an emerging Web3 platform and a well-established e-commerce website. Overall, we conducted the experimental evaluation of the framework over four temporal heterogeneous network datasets on future link prediction tasks in an evaluation setting that takes into account the evolving nature of the data. Experiments show the prediction power of DURENDAL compared to current solutions for evolving and dynamic graphs, and the effectiveness of its model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04452v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Grained Preference Enhanced Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12179v2)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item according to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item interactions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic heterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender system. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model heterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and modelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other hand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in interaction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced Transformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level graph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph convolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency representation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical cross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a novel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user preference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential pattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference . Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Knowledge Graph-enhanced Sampling for Conversational Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06637v1)** | 2021-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional recommendation systems mainly use offline user data to train offline models, and then recommend items for online users, thus suffering from the unreliable estimation of user preferences based on sparse and noisy historical data. Conversational Recommendation System (CRS) uses the interactive form of the dialogue systems to solve the intrinsic problems of traditional recommendation systems. However, due to the lack of contextual information modeling, the existing CRS models are unable to deal with the exploitation and exploration (E&E) problem well, resulting in the heavy burden on users. To address the aforementioned issue, this work proposes a contextual information enhancement model tailored for CRS, called Knowledge Graph-enhanced Sampling (KGenSam). KGenSam integrates the dynamic graph of user interaction data with the external knowledge into one heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (KG) as the contextual information environment. Then, two samplers are designed to enhance knowledge by sampling fuzzy samples with high uncertainty for obtaining user preferences and reliable negative samples for updating recommender to achieve efficient acquisition of user preferences and model updating, and thus provide a powerful solution for CRS to deal with E&E problem. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of KGenSam with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Aware Denoising Graph Neural Network for Micro-Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13527v1)** | 2021-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, micro-video sharing platforms such as Kuaishou and Tiktok have become a major source of information for people's lives. Thanks to the large traffic volume, short video lifespan and streaming fashion of these services, it has become more and more pressing to improve the existing recommender systems to accommodate these challenges in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we propose a novel concept-aware denoising graph neural network (named CONDE) for micro-video recommendation. CONDE consists of a three-phase graph convolution process to derive user and micro-video representations: warm-up propagation, graph denoising and preference refinement. A heterogeneous tripartite graph is constructed by connecting user nodes with video nodes, and video nodes with associated concept nodes, extracted from captions and comments of the videos. To address the noisy information in the graph, we introduce a user-oriented graph denoising phase to extract a subgraph which can better reflect the user's preference. Despite the main focus of micro-video recommendation in this paper, we also show that our method can be generalized to other types of tasks. Therefore, we also conduct empirical studies on a well-known public E-commerce dataset. The experimental results suggest that the proposed CONDE achieves significantly better recommendation performance than the existing state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> | 9 pages |

As the interpretation of GNNs becomes increasingly important, the demand for robust baselines and expansive graph datasets is accentuated, particularly in the context of Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). Addressing this, we introduce SynHING, a novel framework for Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation aimed at enhancing graph learning and explanation. SynHING systematically identifies major motifs in a target HIN and employs a bottom-up generation process with intra-cluster and inter-cluster merge modules. This process, supplemented by post-pruning techniques, ensures the synthetic HIN closely mirrors the original graph's structural and statistical properties. Crucially, SynHING provides ground-truth motifs for evaluating GNN explainer models, setting a new standard for explainable, synthetic HIN generation and contributing to the advancement of interpretable machine learning in complex networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update figures, tables, and content</p></details> |
| **[FedGRec: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Federated Graph Learning for Secure and Efficient Cross-Border Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18177v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the highly sensitive nature of certain data in cross-border sharing, collaborative cross-border recommendations and data sharing are often subject to stringent privacy protection regulations, resulting in insufficient data for model training. Consequently, achieving efficient cross-border business recommendations while ensuring privacy security poses a significant challenge. Although federated learning has demonstrated broad potential in collaborative training without exposing raw data, most existing federated learning-based GNN training methods still rely on federated averaging strategies, which perform suboptimally on highly heterogeneous graph data. To address this issue, we propose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for cross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from distributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all domains without privacy leakage. Specifically, FedGRec leverages collaborative signals from local subgraphs associated with users or items to enrich their representation learning. Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal modeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on business recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of target users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant behaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable neighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy, FedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling collaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FedGRec consistently outperforms competitive single-domain and cross-domain baselines while effectively preserving data privacy in cross-border recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions integrate user-item interaction modeling into bundle recommendation by sharing model parameters or learning in a multi-task manner, which cannot explicitly model the affiliation between items and bundles, and fail to explore the decision-making when a user chooses bundles. In this work, we propose a graph neural network model named BGCN (short for \textit{\textBF{B}undle \textBF{G}raph \textBF{C}onvolutional \textBF{N}etwork}) for bundle recommendation. BGCN unifies user-item interaction, user-bundle interaction and bundle-item affiliation into a heterogeneous graph. With item nodes as the bridge, graph convolutional propagation between user and bundle nodes makes the learned representations capture the item level semantics. Through training based on hard-negative sampler, the user's fine-grained preferences for similar bundles are further distinguished. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the strong performance gains of BGCN, which outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 10.77\% to 23.18\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2020 (Short)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Meta Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03969v1)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems often embed users and items into low-dimensional latent representations, based on their observed interactions. In practical recommendation scenarios, users often exhibit various intents which drive them to interact with items with multiple behavior types (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, purchase). However, the diversity of user behaviors is ignored in most of the existing approaches, which makes them difficult to capture heterogeneous relational structures across different types of interactive behaviors. Exploring multi-typed behavior patterns is of great importance to recommendation systems, yet is very challenging because of two aspects: i) The complex dependencies across different types of user-item interactions; ii) Diversity of such multi-behavior patterns may vary by users due to their personalized preference. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a Multi-Behavior recommendation framework with Graph Meta Network to incorporate the multi-behavior pattern modeling into a meta-learning paradigm. Our developed MB-GMN empowers the user-item interaction learning with the capability of uncovering type-dependent behavior representations, which automatically distills the behavior heterogeneity and interaction diversity for recommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MB-GMN by significantly boosting the recommendation performance as compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

Several MOOC platforms offer the service of course recommendation to users, to improve the learning experience of users. Despite the usefulness of this service, we consider that recommending courses to users directly may neglect their varying degrees of expertise. To mitigate this gap, we examine an interesting problem of concept recommendation in this paper, which can be viewed as recommending knowledge to users in a fine-grained way. We put forward a novel approach, termed HinCRec-RL, for Concept Recommendation in MOOCs, which is based on Heterogeneous Information Networks and Reinforcement Learning. In particular, we propose to shape the problem of concept recommendation within a reinforcement learning framework to characterize the dynamic interaction between users and knowledge concepts in MOOCs. Furthermore, we propose to form the interactions among users, courses, videos, and concepts into a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to learn the semantic user representations better. We then employ an attentional graph neural network to represent the users in the HIN, based on meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset collected from a Chinese MOOC platform, XuetangX, to validate the efficacy of our proposed HinCRec-RL. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our proposed HinCRec-RL performs well when comparing with several state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

It is a central problem in many machine learning tasks (e.g., node classification, recommendation, community detection). The key problem in graph node embedding lies in how to define the dependence to neighbors. Existing approaches specify (either explicitly or implicitly) certain dependencies on neighbors, which may lead to loss of subtle but important structural information within the graph and other dependencies among neighbors. This intrigues us to ask the question: can we design a model to give the maximal flexibility of dependencies to each node's neighborhood. In this paper, we propose a novel graph node embedding (named PINE) via a novel notion of partial permutation invariant set function, to capture any possible dependence. Our method 1) can learn an arbitrary form of the representation function from the neighborhood, withour losing any potential dependence structures, and 2) is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph embedding, the latter of which is challenged by the diversity of node types. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantee for the representation capability of our method for general homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Empirical evaluation results on benchmark data sets show that our proposed PINE method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on producing node vectors for various learning tasks of both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1805.11182</p></details> |

Many modern recommendation systems are split into multiple stages - candidate generation and heavy ranking - to balance computational cost against recommendation quality. We focus on the candidate generation phase of a large-scale ads recommendation problem in this paper, and present a machine learning first heterogeneous re-architecture of this stage which we term TwERC. We show that a system that combines a real-time light ranker with sourcing strategies capable of capturing additional information provides validated gains. We present two strategies. The first strategy uses a notion of similarity in the interaction graph, while the second strategy caches previous scores from the ranking stage. The graph based strategy achieves a 4.08% revenue gain and the rankscore based strategy achieves a 1.38% gain. These two strategies have biases that complement both the light ranker and one another. Finally, we describe a set of metrics that we believe are valuable as a means of understanding the complex product trade offs inherent in industrial candidate generation systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

While existing research has been largely focused on enhancing HGNNs' predictive performance, their robustness and security, especially under backdoor attacks, remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Backdoor Attack (HeteroBA) framework for node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. HeteroBA inserts carefully crafted trigger nodes with realistic features and targeted structural connections, leveraging attention-based and clustering-based strategies to select influential auxiliary nodes for effective trigger propagation, thereby causing the model to misclassify specific nodes into a target label while maintaining accuracy on clean data. Experimental results on three datasets and various HGNN architectures demonstrate that HeteroBA achieves high attack success rates with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Our method sheds light on potential vulnerabilities in HGNNs and calls for more robust defenses against backdoor threats in multi-relational graph scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

Notably, it is challenging and critical to consider both the developers' interests and the semantic features of the project code to recommend appropriate development tasks to OSS developers. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of code recommendation, whose purpose is to predict the future contribution behaviors of developers given their interaction history, the semantic features of source code, and the hierarchical file structures of projects. Considering the complex interactions among multiple parties within the system, we propose CODER, a novel graph-based code recommendation framework for open source software developers. CODER jointly models microscopic user-code interactions and macroscopic user-project interactions via a heterogeneous graph and further bridges the two levels of information through aggregation on file-structure graphs that reflect the project hierarchy. Moreover, due to the lack of reliable benchmarks, we construct three large-scale datasets to facilitate future research in this direction.

| **[MVIN: Learning Multiview Items for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12516v1)** | 2020-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have begun to utilize heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information in recommendation systems to mitigate the cold start and sparsity issues. However, utilizing a graph neural network (GNN) to capture information in KG and further apply in RS is still problematic as it is unable to see each item's properties from multiple perspectives. To address these issues, we propose the multi-view item network (MVIN), a GNN-based recommendation model which provides superior recommendations by describing items from a unique mixed view from user and entity angles. MVIN learns item representations from both the user view and the entity view. From the user view, user-oriented modules score and aggregate features to make recommendations from a personalized perspective constructed according to KG entities which incorporates user click information. From the entity view, the mixing layer contrasts layer-wise GCN information to further obtain comprehensive features from internal entity-entity interactions in the KG. We evaluate MVIN on three real-world datasets: MovieLens-1M (ML-1M), LFM-1b 2015 (LFM-1b), and Amazon-Book (AZ-book). Results show that MVIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these three datasets. In addition, from user-view cases, we find that MVIN indeed captures entities that attract users. Figures further illustrate that mixing layers in a heterogeneous KG plays a vital role in neighborhood information aggregation.</p></details> |  |

Ideally, the courses you take help you identify, get hired for, and perform the job you always wanted. However, not all courses provide skills that transfer to existing and future jobs; skill terms used in course descriptions might be different from those listed in job advertisements; and there might exist a considerable skill gap between what is taught in courses and what is needed for a job. In this study, we propose a novel method to integrate extensive course description and job advertisement data by leveraging heterogeneous data integration and community detection. The innovative heterogeneous graph approach along with identified skill communities enables cross-domain information recommendation, e.g., given an educational profile, job recommendations can be provided together with suggestions on education opportunities for re- and upskilling in support of lifelong learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
