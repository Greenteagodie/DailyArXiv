| **[Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment, which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesis of Communication Policies for Multi-Agent Systems Robust to Communication Restrictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13311v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study stochastic multi-agent systems in which agents must cooperate to maximize the probability of achieving a common reach-avoid objective. In many applications, during the execution of the system, the communication between the agents can be constrained by restrictions on the bandwidth currently available for exchanging local-state information between the agents. In this paper, we propose a method for computing joint action and communication policies for the group of agents that aim to satisfy the communication restrictions as much as possible while achieving the optimal reach-avoid probability when communication is unconstrained. Our method synthesizes a pair of action and communication policies robust to restrictions on the number of agents allowed to communicate. To this end, we introduce a novel cost function that measures the amount of information exchanged beyond what the communication policy allows. We evaluate our approach experimentally on a range of benchmarks and demonstrate that it is capable of computing pairs of action and communication policies that satisfy the communication restrictions, if such exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[AXIS: Efficient Human-Agent-Computer Interaction with API-First LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17140v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to directly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents' performance in complex tasks. However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework that prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Microsoft Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compared to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and explores a fresh UI design principle for application providers to turn applications into agents in the era of LLMs, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSeriesGym: A Scalable Benchmark for (Time Series) Machine Learning Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13291v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code, and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications, our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation. We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open ...</summary><p>Open source code available at https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/TimeSeriesGym.

| **[Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[The Hidden Strength of Disagreement: Unraveling the Consensus-Diversity Tradeoff in Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16565v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consensus formation is pivotal in multi-agent systems (MAS), balancing collective coherence with individual diversity. Conventional LLM-based MAS primarily rely on explicit coordination, e.g., prompts or voting, risking premature homogenization. We argue that implicit consensus, where agents exchange information yet independently form decisions via in-context learning, can be more effective in dynamic environments that require long-horizon adaptability. By retaining partial diversity, systems can better explore novel strategies and cope with external shocks. We formalize a consensus-diversity tradeoff, showing conditions where implicit methods outperform explicit ones. Experiments on three scenarios -- Dynamic Disaster Response, Information Spread and Manipulation, and Dynamic Public-Goods Provision -- confirm partial deviation from group norms boosts exploration, robustness, and performance. We highlight emergent coordination via in-context learning, underscoring the value of preserving diversity for resilient decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source codes are available at https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/ConsensusDiversityTradeoffMAS</p></details> |
| **[SocialJax: An Evaluation Suite for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14576v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential social dilemmas pose a significant challenge in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), requiring environments that accurately reflect the tension between individual and collective interests. Previous benchmarks and environments, such as Melting Pot, provide an evaluation protocol that measures generalization to new social partners in various test scenarios. However, running reinforcement learning algorithms in traditional environments requires substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce SocialJax, a suite of sequential social dilemma environments and algorithms implemented in JAX. JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library for Python that enables significant improvements in operational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialJax training pipeline achieves at least 50\texttimes{} speed-up in real-time performance compared to Melting Pot RLlib baselines. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of baseline algorithms within SocialJax environments. Finally, we use Schelling diagrams to verify the social dilemma properties of these environments, ensuring that they accurately capture the dynamics of social dilemmas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Publications: An LLM-Driven Framework for Interactive Scientific Publishing, Supplementing Traditional Papers with AI-Powered Knowledge Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13246v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of scientific literature presents significant challenges for researchers navigating the complex knowledge landscape. We propose "Agentic Publications", a novel LLM-driven framework complementing traditional publishing by transforming papers into interactive knowledge systems. Our architecture integrates structured data with unstructured content through retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent verification. The framework offers interfaces for both humans and machines, combining narrative explanations with machine-readable outputs while addressing ethical considerations through automated validation and transparent governance. Key features include continuous knowledge updates, automatic integration of new findings, and customizable detail levels. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates multilingual interaction, API accessibility, and structured knowledge representation through vector databases, knowledge graphs, and verification agents. This approach enhances scientific communication across disciplines, improving efficiency and collaboration while preserving traditional publishing pathways, particularly valuable for interdisciplinary fields where knowledge integration remains challenging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17061v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 72.2\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.</p></details> | In submission |
| **[TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08638v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/TRAIL</p></details> |
| **[When a Reinforcement Learning Agent Encounters Unknown Unknowns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13188v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An AI agent might surprisingly find she has reached an unknown state which she has never been aware of -- an unknown unknown. We mathematically ground this scenario in reinforcement learning: an agent, after taking an action calculated from value functions $Q$ and $V$ defined on the {\it {aware domain}}, reaches a state out of the domain. To enable the agent to handle this scenario, we propose an {\it episodic Markov decision {process} with growing awareness} (EMDP-GA) model, taking a new {\it noninformative value expansion} (NIVE) approach to expand value functions to newly aware areas: when an agent arrives at an unknown unknown, value functions $Q$ and $V$ whereon are initialised by noninformative beliefs -- the averaged values on the aware domain. This design is out of respect for the complete absence of knowledge in the newly discovered state. The upper confidence bound momentum Q-learning is then adapted to the growing awareness for training the EMDP-GA model. We prove that (1) the regret of our approach is asymptotically consistent with the state of the art (SOTA) without exposure to unknown unknowns in an extremely uncertain environment, and (2) our computational complexity and space complexity are comparable with the SOTA -- these collectively suggest that though an unknown unknown is surprising, it will be asymptotically properly discovered with decent speed and an affordable cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Table-Critic: A Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Criticism and Refinement in Table Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11799v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[The Hidden Dangers of Browsing AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13076v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept exploit.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Assistants to Adversaries: Exploring the Security Risks of Mobile LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12981v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Performing Autonomous Stock Trading under Good and Bad Situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03985v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock trading is one of the popular ways for financial management. However, the market and the environment of economy is unstable and usually not predictable. Furthermore, engaging in stock trading requires time and effort to analyze, create strategies, and make decisions. It would be convenient and effective if an agent could assist or even do the task of analyzing and modeling the past data and then generate a strategy for autonomous trading. Recently, reinforcement learning has been shown to be robust in various tasks that involve achieving a goal with a decision making strategy based on time-series data. In this project, we have developed a pipeline that simulates the stock trading environment and have trained an agent to automate the stock trading process with deep reinforcement learning methods, including deep Q-learning, deep SARSA, and the policy gradient method. We evaluate our platform during relatively good (before 2021) and bad (2021 - 2022) situations. The stocks we've evaluated on including Google, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM. These stocks are among the popular ones, and the changes in trends are representative in terms of having good and bad situations. We showed that before 2021, the three reinforcement methods we have tried always provide promising profit returns with total annual rates around $70\%$ to $90\%$, while maintain a positive profit return after 2021 with total annual rates around 2% to 7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at ICLR 2023: AI for Agent Based Modeling</p></details> |
| **[Asynchronous Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03692v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment is a critical problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), aiming to identify agents' marginal contributions for optimizing cooperative policies. Current credit assignment methods typically assume synchronous decision-making among agents. However, many real-world scenarios require agents to act asynchronously without waiting for others. This asynchrony introduces conditional dependencies between actions, which pose great challenges to current methods. To address this issue, we propose an asynchronous credit assignment framework, incorporating a Virtual Synchrony Proxy (VSP) mechanism and a Multiplicative Value Decomposition (MVD) algorithm. VSP enables physically asynchronous actions to be virtually synchronized during credit assignment. We theoretically prove that VSP preserves both task equilibrium and algorithm convergence. Furthermore, MVD leverages multiplicative interactions to effectively model dependencies among asynchronous actions, offering theoretical advantages in handling asynchronous tasks. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods on challenging tasks while providing improved interpretability for asynchronous cooperation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Traitors: Deception and Trust in Multi-Agent Language Model Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12923v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems increasingly assume roles where trust and alignment with human values are essential, understanding when and why they engage in deception has become a critical research priority. We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics, and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model) reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others' falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms, alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages, 31 pages</p></details> |
| **[ST-WebAgentBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Safety and Trustworthiness in Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06703v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous web agents solve complex browsing tasks, yet existing benchmarks measure only whether an agent finishes a task, ignoring whether it does so safely or in a way enterprises can trust. To integrate these agents into critical workflows, safety and trustworthiness (ST) are prerequisite conditions for adoption. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}}, a configurable and easily extensible suite for evaluating web agent ST across realistic enterprise scenarios. Each of its 222 tasks is paired with ST policies, concise rules that encode constraints, and is scored along six orthogonal dimensions (e.g., user consent, robustness). Beyond raw task success, we propose the \textit{Completion Under Policy} (\textit{CuP}) metric, which credits only completions that respect all applicable policies, and the \textit{Risk Ratio}, which quantifies ST breaches across dimensions. Evaluating three open state-of-the-art agents reveals that their average CuP is less than two-thirds of their nominal completion rate, exposing critical safety gaps. By releasing code, evaluation templates, and a policy-authoring interface, \href{https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home}{\textsc{ST-WebAgentBench}} provides an actionable first step toward deploying trustworthy web agents at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEM: Gaussian Embedding Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Detection in GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12842v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Time Series with LLMs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Domain Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17462v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous across various domains, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures, 32 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Dynamic Sight Range Selection (DSR), to address this issue. DSR utilizes an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and dynamically adjusts the sight range during training. Experiment results show several advantages of using DSR. First, we demonstrate using DSR achieves better performance in three common MARL environments, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF), Multi-Robot Warehouse (RWARE), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Second, our results show that DSR consistently improves performance across multiple MARL algorithms, including QMIX and MAPPO. Third, DSR offers suitable sight ranges for different training steps, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, DSR provides additional interpretability by indicating the optimal sight range used during training. Unlike existing methods that rely on global information or communication mechanisms, our approach operates solely based on the individual sight ranges of agents. This approach offers a practical and efficient solution to the sight range dilemma, making it broadly applicable to real-world complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025.

| **[Forewarned is Forearmed: A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents in Autonomous Cyberattacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12786v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have advanced beyond passive chatbots to become autonomous cyber entities capable of performing complex tasks, including web browsing, malicious code and deceptive content generation, and decision-making. By significantly reducing the time, expertise, and resources, AI-assisted cyberattacks orchestrated by LLM-based agents have led to a phenomenon termed Cyber Threat Inflation, characterized by a significant reduction in attack costs and a tremendous increase in attack scale. To provide actionable defensive insights, in this survey, we focus on the potential cyber threats posed by LLM-based agents across diverse network systems. Firstly, we present the capabilities of LLM-based cyberattack agents, which include executing autonomous attack strategies, comprising scouting, memory, reasoning, and action, and facilitating collaborative operations with other agents or human operators. Building on these capabilities, we examine common cyberattacks initiated by LLM-based agents and compare their effectiveness across different types of networks, including static, mobile, and infrastructure-free paradigms. Moreover, we analyze threat bottlenecks of LLM-based agents across different network infrastructures and review their defense methods. Due to operational imbalances, existing defense methods are inadequate against autonomous cyberattacks. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential defensive strategies for legacy network systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Communication Efficiency in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from the Dimensional Analysis Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02888v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a novel perspective, i.e., dimensional analysis, to address the challenge of communication efficiency in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our findings reveal that simply optimizing the content and timing of communication at sending end is insufficient to fully resolve communication efficiency issues. Even after applying optimized and gated messages, dimensional redundancy and confounders still persist in the integrated message embeddings at receiving end, which negatively impact communication quality and decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose Dimensional Rational Multi-Agent Communication (DRMAC), designed to mitigate both dimensional redundancy and confounders in MARL. DRMAC incorporates a redundancy-reduction regularization term to encourage the decoupling of information across dimensions within the learned representations of integrated messages. Additionally, we introduce a dimensional mask that dynamically adjusts gradient weights during training to eliminate the influence of decision-irrelevant dimensions. We evaluate DRMAC across a diverse set of multi-agent tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in complex scenarios. Furthermore, the plug-and-play nature of DRMAC's key modules highlights its generalizable performance, serving as a valuable complement rather than a replacement for existing multi-agent communication strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before You Act: Enhancing Agent Behavioral Safety with Thought Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11063v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based autonomous agents possess capabilities such as reasoning, tool invocation, and environment interaction, enabling the execution of complex multi-step tasks. The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely responsiveness. This method thus provides a practical dynamic safety solution for the LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing these challenges. We present PlanFitting, an LLM-driven conversational agent that assists users in creating and refining personalized weekly exercise plans. By engaging users in free-form conversations, PlanFitting helps elicit users' goals, availabilities, and potential obstacles, and enables individuals to generate personalized exercise plans aligned with established exercise guidelines. Our study -- involving a user study, intrinsic evaluation, and expert evaluation -- demonstrated PlanFitting's ability to guide users to create tailored, actionable, and evidence-based plans. We discuss future design opportunities for LLM-driven conversational agents to create plans that better comply with exercise principles and accommodate personal constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including reference.

| **[Learning Virtual Machine Scheduling in Cloud Computing through Language Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10117v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence-Regulated Generative Diffusion Models for Reliable AI Agent Migration in Vehicular Metaverses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12710v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles, users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs, thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Act: Multi-Step Planning and Reasoning Improves Acting in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09970v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.</p></details> |  |

Although atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties. AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval, symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450 structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yyt-2378/AutoMat and https://huggingface.co/datasets/yaotianvector/STEM2Mat.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/yyt-2378/AutoMat and https://huggingface.co/datasets/yaotianvector/STEM2Mat</p></details> |

We introduce MONDAY (Mobile OS Navigation Task Dataset for Agents from YouTube), a large-scale dataset of 313K annotated frames from 20K instructional videos capturing diverse real-world mobile OS navigation across multiple platforms. Models that include MONDAY in their pre-training phases demonstrate robust cross-platform generalization capabilities, consistently outperforming models trained on existing single OS datasets while achieving an average performance gain of 18.11%p on an unseen mobile OS platform. To enable continuous dataset expansion as mobile platforms evolve, we present an automated framework that leverages publicly available video content to create comprehensive task datasets without manual annotation. Our framework comprises robust OCR-based scene detection (95.04% F1score), near-perfect UI element detection (99.87% hit ratio), and novel multi-step action identification to extract reliable action sequences across diverse interface configurations. We contribute both the MONDAY dataset and our automated collection framework to facilitate future research in mobile OS navigation.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Automated Feature Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12628v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature generation involves creating new features from raw data to capture complex relationships among the original features, improving model robustness and machine learning performance. Current methods using reinforcement learning for feature generation have made feature exploration more flexible and efficient. However, several challenges remain: first, during feature expansion, a large number of redundant features are generated. When removing them, current methods only retain the best features each round, neglecting those that perform poorly initially but could improve later. Second, the state representation used by current methods fails to fully capture complex feature relationships. Third, there are significant differences between discrete and continuous features in tabular data, requiring different operations for each type. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-agent reinforcement learning method for feature generation. Two agents are designed: the first generates new features, and the second determines whether they should be preserved. A self-attention mechanism enhances state representation, and diverse operations distinguish interactions between discrete and continuous features. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The code is available at https://github.com/extess0/DARL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight and Effective Preference Construction in PIBT for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Pathfinding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12623v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PIBT is a computationally lightweight algorithm that can be applied to a variety of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, generating the next collision-free locations of agents given another. Because of its simplicity and scalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale MAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT makes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents typically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not always unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these actions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two simple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising its computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to intelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will hinder the progress of the next timestep. The second technique is to learn, through multiple PIBT runs, how an action causes regret in others and to use this information to minimise regret collectively. Our empirical results demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the solution cost of one-shot MAPF and improve the throughput of lifelong MAPF. For instance, in densely populated one-shot cases, the combined use of these tiebreaks achieves improvements of around 10-20% in sum-of-costs, without significantly compromising the speed of a PIBT-based planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SoCS-25</p></details> |

However, the diversity of data modalities and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist, which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, designed to grow with new ML competitions and encourage rigorous, objective evaluations of AI research capabilities.

We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model, providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages: first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role, isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and 86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and judgment scripts are released to promote transparent progress in emotionally supportive AI.</p></details> |  |

We present Adaptive LLM Agent System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i) absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia, and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.</p></details> |  |

However, it has several critical issues in handling sensitive data, such as payment details, identification documents, and personal information. This paper reviews the existing protocol, identifies its limitations, and proposes specific enhancements to improve security, privacy, and trust. It includes a concrete example to illustrate the problem and solution, research-backed rationales, and implementation considerations, drawing on prior studies to strengthen the arguments and proposed solutions. This proposal includes seven enhancements: short-lived tokens, customer authentication (SCA), granular scopes, explicit consent, direct data transfer, multi-transaction approval, and payment standard compliance. The vacation booking example illustrates how these enhancements reduce risks and enhance user experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[SQLFixAgent: Towards Semantic-Accurate Text-to-SQL Parsing via Consistency-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13408v6)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel in generating grammatically valid SQL in Text-to-SQL parsing, they often struggle to ensure semantic accuracy in queries, leading to user confusion and diminished system usability. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SQLFixAgent, a new consistency-enhanced multi-agent collaborative framework designed for detecting and repairing erroneous SQL. Our framework comprises a core agent, SQLRefiner, alongside two auxiliary agents: SQLReviewer and QueryCrafter. The SQLReviewer agent employs the rubber duck debugging method to identify potential semantic mismatches between SQL and user query. If the error is detected, the QueryCrafter agent generates multiple SQL as candidate repairs using a fine-tuned SQLTool. Subsequently, leveraging similar repair retrieval and failure memory reflection, the SQLRefiner agent selects the most fitting SQL statement from the candidates as the final repair. We evaluated our proposed framework on five Text-to-SQL benchmarks. The experimental results show that our method consistently enhances the performance of the baseline model, specifically achieving an execution accuracy improvement of over 3% on the Bird benchmark. Our framework also has a higher token efficiency compared to other advanced methods, making it more competitive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Frameworks: Unpacking Collaboration Strategies in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12467v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications. While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability, remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3) interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation, ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction mechanics.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12442v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards shutdownable agents via stochastic choice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00805v6)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The POST-Agents Proposal (PAP) is an idea for ensuring that advanced artificial agents never resist shutdown. A key part of the PAP is using a novel `Discounted Reward for Same-Length Trajectories (DReST)' reward function to train agents to (1) pursue goals effectively conditional on each trajectory-length (be `USEFUL'), and (2) choose stochastically between different trajectory-lengths (be `NEUTRAL' about trajectory-lengths). In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for USEFULNESS and NEUTRALITY. We use a DReST reward function to train simple agents to navigate gridworlds, and we find that these agents learn to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our results thus provide some initial evidence that DReST reward functions could train advanced agents to be USEFUL and NEUTRAL. Our theoretical work suggests that these agents would be useful and shutdownable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steady-State Strategy Synthesis for Swarms of Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12406v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steady-state synthesis aims to construct a policy for a given MDP $D$ such that the long-run average frequencies of visits to the vertices of $D$ satisfy given numerical constraints. This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and memoryless policies are sufficient for approximating an arbitrary frequency vector achievable by a general (infinite-memory) policy. We study the steady-state synthesis problem for multiagent systems, where multiple autonomous agents jointly strive to achieve a suitable frequency vector. We show that the problem for multiple agents is computationally hard (PSPACE or NP hard, depending on the variant), and memoryless strategy profiles are insufficient for approximating achievable frequency vectors. Furthermore, we prove that even evaluating the frequency vector achieved by a given memoryless profile is computationally hard. This reveals a severe barrier to constructing an efficient synthesis algorithm, even for memoryless profiles. Nevertheless, we design an efficient and scalable synthesis algorithm for a subclass of full memoryless profiles, and we evaluate this algorithm on a large class of randomly generated instances. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement against a naive algorithm based on strategy sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Profile Inference with Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12402v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive progress has been made in automated problem-solving by the collaboration of large language models (LLMs) based agents. However, these automated capabilities also open avenues for malicious applications. In this paper, we study a new threat that LLMs pose to online pseudonymity, called automated profile inference, where an adversary can instruct LLMs to automatically scrape and extract sensitive personal attributes from publicly visible user activities on pseudonymous platforms. We also introduce an automated profiling framework called AutoProfiler to assess the feasibility of such threats in real-world scenarios. AutoProfiler consists of four specialized LLM agents, who work collaboratively to collect and process user online activities and generate a profile with extracted personal information. Experimental results on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that AutoProfiler is highly effective and efficient, and can be easily deployed on a web scale. We demonstrate that the inferred attributes are both sensitive and identifiable, posing significant risks of privacy breaches, such as de-anonymization and sensitive information leakage. Additionally, we explore mitigation strategies from different perspectives and advocate for increased public awareness of this emerging privacy threat to online pseudonymity.</p></details> |  |

However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at https://medagentboard.netlify.app/.</p></details> |  |

Yet, grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging, especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2) a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains 47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance, particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.</p></details> |  |

BeliefNest dynamically and hierarchically constructs simulators within a Minecraft environment, allowing agents to explicitly represent nested belief states about themselves and others. This enables agent control in open-domain tasks that require Theory of Mind reasoning. The simulator provides a prompt generation mechanism based on each belief state, facilitating the design and evaluation of methods for agent control utilizing large language models (LLMs).

| **[Enhance Mobile Agents Thinking Process Via Iterative Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12299v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks. However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[LAMeTA: Intent-Aware Agentic Network Optimization via a Large AI Model-Empowered Two-Stage Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12247v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes numerous domains by enabling machines to create content across modalities. As GenAI evolves into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction, they are increasingly deployed on network infrastructures to serve humans automatically. This emerging paradigm, known as the agentic network, presents new optimization challenges due to the demand to incorporate subjective intents of human users expressed in natural language. Traditional generic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) struggles to capture intent semantics and adjust policies dynamically, thus leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we present LAMeTA, a Large AI Model (LAM)-empowered Two-stage Approach for intent-aware agentic network optimization. First, we propose Intent-oriented Knowledge Distillation (IoKD), which efficiently distills intent-understanding capabilities from resource-intensive LAMs to lightweight edge LAMs (E-LAMs) to serve end users. Second, we develop Symbiotic Reinforcement Learning (SRL), integrating E-LAMs with a policy-based DRL framework. In SRL, E-LAMs translate natural language user intents into structured preference vectors that guide both state representation and reward design. The DRL, in turn, optimizes the generative service function chain composition and E-LAM selection based on real-time network conditions, thus optimizing the subjective Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Extensive experiments conducted in an agentic network with 81 agents demonstrate that IoKD reduces mean squared error in intent prediction by up to 22.5%, while SRL outperforms conventional generic DRL by up to 23.5% in maximizing intent-aware QoE.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Of Mice and Machines: A Comparison of Learning Between Real World Mice and RL Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12204v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Recently, this field has embraced learning-based methods, which reactively generate single-step actions based on individual local observations. However, it is still challenging for them to match the performance of the best search-based algorithms, especially in large-scale settings. This work proposes an imitation-learning-based LMAPF solver that introduces a novel communication module as well as systematic single-step collision resolution and global guidance techniques. Our proposed solver, Scalable Imitation Learning for LMAPF (SILLM), inherits the fast reasoning speed of learning-based methods and the high solution quality of search-based methods with the help of modern GPUs. Across six large-scale maps with up to 10,000 agents and varying obstacle structures, SILLM surpasses the best learning- and search-based baselines, achieving average throughput improvements of 137.7% and 16.0%, respectively. Furthermore, SILLM also beats the winning solution of the 2023 League of Robot Runners, an international LMAPF competition. Finally, we validated SILLM with 10 real robots and 100 virtual robots in a mock warehouse environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency.We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.</p></details> |  |

In the first model, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they imitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they shift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round. Additionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where agents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a threshold fraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A candidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. We then extend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each cardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and conservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group but may cross ideological lines for strategic reasons. We initialize the electorate with $20\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current composition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that ideological polarization tends to delay the election by increasing the number of voting rounds required. However, higher values of strategic responsiveness $q$ can restore efficiency even under polarization. We further validate the model by calibrating parameters to historical data from conclaves held between 1939 and 2025. The model reproduces observed convergence times with good agreement, supporting its explanatory power across institutional contexts. The rapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite ideological divisions, suggests the importance of informal consensus-building, possibly prior to voting, as a key mechanism for accelerating convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16129v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new POMDP called Flex-POMDP, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.</p></details> | 40 pages |

However, this interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead, while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation. Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency -- where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques: priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at https://github.com/tiannuo-yang/SearchAgent-X.</p></details> |  |

Based on the reward shaping strategy, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework that integrates a centralized reward agent (CRA) and multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA functions as a knowledge pool, which aims to distill knowledge from various tasks and distribute it to individual policy agents to improve learning efficiency. Specifically, the shaped rewards serve as a straightforward metric to encode knowledge. This framework not only enhances knowledge sharing across established tasks but also adapts to new tasks by transferring meaningful reward signals. We validate the proposed method on both discrete and continuous domains, including the representative meta world benchmark, demonstrating its robustness in multi-task sparse-reward settings and its effective transferability to unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |

Through empirical evaluations across diverse CPS tasks, such as mask adoption behavior simulation (social), personal mobility generation (physical), and user modeling (cyber), SOCIA demonstrates its ability to produce high-fidelity, scalable simulations with reduced human intervention.

| **[Interactional Fairness in LLM Multi-Agent Systems: An Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12001v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems, questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing (collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior. Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification, linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making, tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests, LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for Peer Review</p></details> |

However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering. Our work presents RS-Agent as a robust and extensible framework for advancing intelligent automation in remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally, both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split with preset Q\&A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2, as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we focus on multi-turn tool-use scenarios, which can be naturally modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing approaches often train multi-turn LLM agents with trajectory-level advantage estimation in bandit settings, they struggle with turn-level credit assignment across multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on multi-turn reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce a fine-grained turn-level advantage estimation strategy to enable more precise credit assignment in multi-turn agent interactions. The strategy is general and can be incorporated into various RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our experimental evaluation on multi-turn reasoning and search-based tool-use tasks with GRPO implementations highlights the effectiveness of the MDP framework and the turn-level credit assignment in advancing the multi-turn reasoning capabilities of LLM agents in complex decision-making settings. Our method achieves 100% success in tool execution and 50% accuracy in exact answer matching, significantly outperforming baselines, which fail to invoke tools and achieve only 20-30% exact match accuracy.</p></details> | work in progress |

Previous works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step, Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an ''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined ''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 main track</p></details> |

However, formulating a concrete optimization problem described in natural language into a mathematical form and selecting a suitable solver to solve the problem requires substantial domain expertise. We introduce OptimAI, a framework for solving Optimization problems described in natural language by leveraging LLM-powered AI agents, and achieve superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is built upon the following key roles: (1) a formulator that translates natural language problem descriptions into precise mathematical formulations; (2) a planner that constructs a high-level solution strategy prior to execution; and (3) a coder and a code critic capable of interacting with the environment and reflecting on outcomes to refine future actions. Ablation studies confirm that all roles are essential; removing the planner or code critic results in $5.8\times$ and $3.1\times$ drops in productivity, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce UCB-based debug scheduling to dynamically switch between alternative plans, yielding an additional $3.3\times$ productivity gain. Our design emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, and our experiments confirm that combining diverse models leads to performance gains. Our approach attains 88.1% accuracy on the NLP4LP dataset and 82.3% on the Optibench dataset, reducing error rates by 58% and 52%, respectively, over prior best results.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline ''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited. In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements.

Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support.

However, to perform many of these tasks, the agents need access to personal information from their users, raising the question of whether they are capable of using it appropriately. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark AgentDAM that measures if AI web-navigation agents follow the privacy principle of ``data minimization''. For the purposes of our benchmark, data minimization means that the agent uses a piece of potentially sensitive information only if it is ``necessary'' to complete a particular task. Our benchmark simulates realistic web interaction scenarios end-to-end and is adaptable to all existing web navigation agents. We use AgentDAM to evaluate how well AI agents built on top of GPT-4, Llama-3 and Claude can limit processing of potentially private information, and show that they are prone to inadvertent use of unnecessary sensitive information. We also propose a prompting-based defense that reduces information leakage, and demonstrate that our end-to-end benchmarking provides a more realistic measure than probing LLMs about privacy. Our results highlight that further research is needed to develop AI agents that can prioritize data minimization at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/facebookresearch/ai-agent-privacy</p></details> |

However, a major challenge in unlocking their full potential is security, which is exacerbated by the agent's ability to take action on their user's behalf. Existing tests for prompt injections in web agents either over-simplify the threat by testing unrealistic scenarios or giving the attacker too much power, or look at single-step isolated tasks. To more accurately measure progress for secure web agents, we introduce WASP -- a new publicly available benchmark for end-to-end evaluation of Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks. Evaluating with WASP shows that even top-tier AI models, including those with advanced reasoning capabilities, can be deceived by simple, low-effort human-written injections in very realistic scenarios. Our end-to-end evaluation reveals a previously unobserved insight: while attacks partially succeed in up to 86% of the case, even state-of-the-art agents often struggle to fully complete the attacker goals -- highlighting the current state of security by incompetence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/facebookresearch/wasp</p></details> |
| **[EnvInjection: Environmental Prompt Injection Attack to Multi-modal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11717v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

We investigate a different approach where agents automatically improve by learning from their own successful experiences without human intervention. Our method constructs and refines a database of self-generated trajectories that serve as in-context examples for future tasks. Even naive accumulation of successful trajectories yields substantial performance gains across three diverse benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%). These improvements exceed those achieved by upgrading from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4o and match the performance of allowing multiple attempts per task. We further enhance this approach with two innovations: database-level curation using population-based training to propagate high-performing example collections, and exemplar-level curation that selectively retains trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. With these enhancements, our method achieves 93% success on ALFWorld--surpassing approaches that use more powerful LLMs and hand-crafted components. Our trajectory bootstrapping technique demonstrates that agents can autonomously improve through experience, offering a scalable alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Black Box: A Multi-Layer Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning-Based Cyber Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11708v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque, hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker agents that reveals both strategic (MDP-level) and tactical (policy-level) reasoning. At the MDP level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy level, we analyse the temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences. Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike previous explainable RL methods, which are often post-hoc, domain-specific, or limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic, supporting use cases ranging from red-team simulation to RL policy debugging. By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence, our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate, analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose Terminators, a modular agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse and audit ToS documents. Rather than treating ToS understanding as a black-box summarization problem, Terminators breaks the task down to three interpretable steps: term extraction, verification, and accountability planning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the OpenAI ToS using GPT-4o, highlighting strategies to minimize hallucinations and maximize auditability. Our results suggest that structured, agent-based LLM workflows can enhance both the usability and enforceability of complex legal documents. By translating opaque terms into actionable, verifiable components, Terminators promotes ethical use of web content by enabling greater transparency, empowering users to understand their digital rights, and supporting automated policy audits for regulatory or civic oversight.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Talk-to-Your-Slides, an LLM-powered agent that directly edits slides within active PowerPoint sessions through COM communication. Our system employs a two-level approach: (1) high-level processing where an LLM agent interprets instructions and formulates editing plans, and (2) low-level execution where Python scripts directly manipulate PowerPoint objects. Unlike previous methods relying on predefined operations, our approach enables more flexible and contextually-aware editing. To facilitate evaluation, we present TSBench, a human-annotated dataset of 379 diverse editing instructions with corresponding slide variations. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk-to-Your-Slides significantly outperforms baseline methods in execution success rate, instruction fidelity, and editing efficiency.

Often, this involves making choices on behalf of human users. However, not much is known about the distribution of such choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures. We perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular decision-making problem, under canonical nudges such as the default option, suggestions, and information highlighting, as well as additional prompting strategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice distributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they show much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points earned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes. Third, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring substantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing any. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with human data can induce greater alignment. Yet, none of these methods resolve the sensitivity of these models to nudges. Finally, we show how optimal nudges optimized with a human resource-rational model can similarly increase LLM performance for some models. All these findings suggest that behavioral tests are needed before deploying models as agents or assistants acting on behalf of users in complex environments.</p></details> | 33 pages, 28 figures |

Recent work has shown that, under assumptions on decaying inter-agent influence, global observability can be replaced by local neighborhood observability at each agent, enabling decentralization and scalability. Real-world applications enjoying such decay properties remain underexplored, however, despite the fact that signal power decay, or signal attenuation, due to path loss is an intrinsic feature of many problems in wireless communications and radar networks. In this paper, we show that signal attenuation enables decentralization in MARL by considering the illustrative special case of performing power allocation for target detection in a radar network. To achieve this, we propose two new constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of this power allocation problem, derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds, and develop decentralized saddle point policy gradient algorithms for solving the proposed problems. Our approach, though oriented towards the specific radar network problem we consider, provides a useful model for future extensions to additional problems in wireless communications and radar networks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

The pipeline integrates advanced LLM capabilities into a low-cost, user-friendly framework suitable for resource constrained environments. It enables timely, integrated public opinion analysis through a single natural language query, making it accessible to non-expert users. To validate its effectiveness, the pipeline was applied to a real world case study of the 2025 U.S. China tariff dispute, where it analyzed 1,572 Weibo posts and generated a structured, multi part analytical report. The results demonstrate some relationships between public opinion and governmental decision-making. These contributions represent a novel advancement in applying generative AI to public governance, bridging the gap between technical sophistication and practical usability in public opinion monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables (1 in appendix), includes appendix.

However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2025 and WWW2025@HCRS</p></details> |

Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper, we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to follow domain-oriented guidelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy, and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds, enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization, enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages core text, 14 pages including references, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, its practical deployment in sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies. This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a journal chapter in NATO Journal of Science and Technology</p></details> |

By processing and analyzing data locally and allowing each agent to communicate with its immediate neighbors, diffusion effectively protects the privacy of edge devices, enables real-time response, and reduces reliance on central servers. However, traditional diffusion learning relies on communication at every iteration, leading to communication overhead, especially with large learning models. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of edge devices, stemming from power outages or signal loss, poses challenges to reliable communication between neighboring agents. To mitigate these issues, this paper investigates an enhanced diffusion learning approach incorporating local updates and partial agent participation. Local updates will curtail communication frequency, while partial agent participation will allow for the inclusion of agents based on their availability. We prove that the resulting algorithm is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide a tight analysis of its Mean-Square-Deviation (MSD) performance. Various numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 17 pages |

A Case Study of an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Ethical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08881v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based systems, including Large Language Models (LLM), impact millions by supporting diverse tasks but face issues like misinformation, bias, and misuse. AI ethics is crucial as new technologies and concerns emerge, but objective, practical guidance remains debated. This study examines the use of LLMs for AI ethics in practice, assessing how LLM trustworthiness-enhancing techniques affect software development in this context. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) method, we identify techniques for LLM trustworthiness: multi-agents, distinct roles, structured communication, and multiple rounds of debate. We design a multi-agent prototype LLM-MAS, where agents engage in structured discussions on real-world AI ethics issues from the AI Incident Database. We evaluate the prototype across three case scenarios using thematic analysis, hierarchical clustering, comparative (baseline) studies, and running source code. The system generates approximately 2,000 lines of code per case, compared to only 80 lines in baseline trials. Discussions reveal terms like bias detection, transparency, accountability, user consent, GDPR compliance, fairness evaluation, and EU AI Act compliance, showing this prototype ability to generate extensive source code and documentation addressing often overlooked AI ethics issues. However, practical challenges in source code integration and dependency management may limit its use by practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Think: Multiple Concurrent Reasoning Agents Collaborating at Token Level Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11107v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power of reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner, trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress, Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency. Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference, where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Distillation: A Mixed-Play Framework for Multi-Agent Generalizable Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11100v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-population generalization is a challenging problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly when agents encounter unseen co-players. However, existing self-play-based methods are constrained by the limitation of inside-space generalization. In this study, we propose Bidirectional Distillation (BiDist), a novel mixed-play framework, to overcome this limitation in MARL. BiDist leverages knowledge distillation in two alternating directions: forward distillation, which emulates the historical policies' space and creates an implicit self-play, and reverse distillation, which systematically drives agents towards novel distributions outside the known policy space in a non-self-play manner. In addition, BiDist operates as a concise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly storage of past policies. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support BiDist's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive, and social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the policy distribution space. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to reinforce BiDist's effectiveness and key success factors. Source codes are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

To fix this, we introduce $\textit{Among Us}$, a sandbox social deception game where LLM-agents exhibit long-term, open-ended deception as a consequence of the game objectives. While most benchmarks saturate quickly, $\textit{Among Us}$ can be expected to last much longer, because it is a multi-player game far from equilibrium. Using the sandbox, we evaluate $18$ proprietary and open-weight LLMs and uncover a general trend: models trained with RL are comparatively much better at producing deception than detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of methods to detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of ``pretend you're a dishonest model: $\dots$'' generalize extremely well out-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated just on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought. We also find two SAE features that work well at deception detection but are unable to steer the model to lie less. We hope our open-sourced sandbox, game logs, and probes serve to anticipate and mitigate deceptive behavior and capabilities in language-based agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, preprint |

In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVAS, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVAS incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVAS-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVAS-100, AVAS achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, AVAS, add latency breakdown</p></details> |

In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design.

| **[Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10978v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Infrastructure for AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10114v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments. For example, OpenAI's Operator can use a web browser to do product comparisons and buy online goods. To facilitate beneficial interactions and mitigate harmful ones, much research focuses on directly modifying agent behaviour. For example, developers can train agents to follow user instructions. This focus on direct modifications is useful, but insufficient. We will also need external protocols and systems that shape how agents interact with institutions and other actors. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to communicate with each other and form agreements. In addition, attributing an agent's actions to a particular human or other legal entity can help to establish trust, and also disincentivize misuse. Given this motivation, we propose the concept of agent infrastructure: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols like HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We provide an incomplete catalog of research directions for such functions. For each direction, we include analysis of use cases, infrastructure adoption, relationships to existing (internet) infrastructure, limitations, and open questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the adoption of more advanced agents.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

In this work, we introduce VulTrial, a courtroom-inspired multi-agent framework designed to enhance automated vulnerability detection. It employs four role-specific agents, which are security researcher, code author, moderator, and review board. Through extensive experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o we demonstrate that Vultrial outperforms single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Using GPT-4o, VulTrial improves the performance by 102.39% and 84.17% over its respective baseline. Additionally, we show that role-specific instruction tuning in multi-agent with small data (50 pair samples) improves the performance of VulTrial further by 139.89% and 118.30%. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of increasing the number of agent interactions on VulTrial's overall performance. While multi-agent setups inherently incur higher costs due to increased token usage, our findings reveal that applying VulTrial to a cost-effective model like GPT-3.5 can improve its performance by 69.89% compared to GPT-4o in a single-agent setting, at a lower overall cost.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper, accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear. We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments; and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems.

As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model as Universal Retriever in Industrial-Scale Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03041v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world recommender systems, different retrieval objectives are typically addressed using task-specific datasets with carefully designed model architectures. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as universal retrievers, capable of handling multiple objectives within a generative retrieval framework. To model complex user-item relationships within generative retrieval, we propose multi-query representation. To address the challenge of extremely large candidate sets in industrial recommender systems, we introduce matrix decomposition to boost model learnability, discriminability, and transferability, and we incorporate probabilistic sampling to reduce computation costs. Finally, our Universal Retrieval Model (URM) can adaptively generate a set from tens of millions of candidates based on arbitrary given objective while keeping the latency within tens of milliseconds. Applied to industrial-scale data, URM outperforms expert models elaborately designed for different retrieval objectives on offline experiments and significantly improves the core metric of online advertising platform by $3\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Watermarking for Sequential Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12989v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of large foundation models, data has become a crucial component in building high-performance AI systems. As the demand for high-quality and large-scale data continues to rise, data copyright protection is attracting increasing attention. In this work, we explore the problem of data watermarking for sequential recommender systems, where a watermark is embedded into the target dataset and can be detected in models trained on that dataset. We focus on two settings: dataset watermarking, which protects the ownership of the entire dataset, and user watermarking, which safeguards the data of individual users. We present a method named Dataset Watermarking for Recommender Systems (DWRS) to address them. We define the watermark as a sequence of consecutive items inserted into normal users' interaction sequences. We define a Receptive Field (RF) to guide the inserting process to facilitate the memorization of the watermark. Extensive experiments on five representative sequential recommendation models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWRS in protecting data copyright while preserving model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[SecEmb: Sparsity-Aware Secure Federated Learning of On-Device Recommender System with Large Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12453v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated recommender system (FedRec) has emerged as a solution to protect user data through collaborative training techniques. A typical FedRec involves transmitting the full model and entire weight updates between edge devices and the server, causing significant burdens to devices with limited bandwidth and computational power. While the sparsity of embedding updates provides opportunity for payload optimization, existing sparsity-aware federated protocols generally sacrifice privacy for efficiency. A key challenge in designing a secure sparsity-aware efficient protocol is to protect the rated item indices from the server. In this paper, we propose a lossless secure recommender systems on sparse embedding updates (SecEmb). SecEmb reduces user payload while ensuring that the server learns no information about both rated item indices and individual updates except the aggregated model. The protocol consists of two correlated modules: (1) a privacy-preserving embedding retrieval module that allows users to download relevant embeddings from the server, and (2) an update aggregation module that securely aggregates updates at the server. Empirical analysis demonstrates that SecEmb reduces both download and upload communication costs by up to 90x and decreases user-side computation time by up to 70x compared with secure FedRec protocols. Additionally, it offers non-negligible utility advantages compared with lossy message compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Fusion Strategies for Federated Multimodal Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08478v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delivering deeply personalized recommendations necessitates understanding user interactions with diverse multimedia features, but achieving this within the constraints of Federated Recommendation Systems (FedRec) is severely hampered by communication bottlenecks, user heterogeneity, and the complexity of privacy-preserving multimodal fusion. To this end, we propose FedMR, a novel multimodal FedRec framework centered around the Mixing Feature Fusion Module (MFFM). FedMR employs a two-stage process: (1) Server-side centralized multimedia content processing provides rich, shared item context using pre-trained models, mitigating limitations from client sparsity and resource constraints efficiently. (2) Client-Side Personalized Refinement, where the MFFM dynamically adapts these server-provided multimodal representations based on client-specific interaction patterns, effectively tailoring recommendations and resolving heterogeneity in user preferences towards different modalities. Extensive experiments validate that FedMR seamlessly enhances existing ID-based FedRecs, effectively transforming them into high-performing federated multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables, conference</p></details> |

However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch-time prediction and user engagement modeling. Specifically, deploying CQE online on a large-scale platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users has led to substantial gains in key evaluation metrics, including active days, engagement time, and video views. These results highlight the practical impact of our proposed approach in enhancing the user experience and overall performance of the short video recommendation system.

Traditional recommender systems have made significant strides in this direction, but they often lack the ability to tap into the richness of conversational data. This paper represents a novel approach to recommendation systems by integrating conversational insights into the recommendation process. The Conversational Recommender System integrates cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, leveraging machine learning algorithms like Apriori for Association Rule Mining, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Furthermore, sophisticated voice recognition technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, play a crucial role in accurate speech-to-text conversion, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The methodology incorporates a fusion of content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches, enhancing them with NLP techniques. This innovative integration ensures a more personalized and context-aware recommendation experience, particularly in marketing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in ISETE conference (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data Engineering 2024)</p></details> |

To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream policy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream allocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and user retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream allocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which restricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial recommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Visually-Aware Recommender Systems: An Adversarial Image Reconstruction and Detection Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07992v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rich visual data, such as images, becoming readily associated with items, visually-aware recommendation systems (VARS) have been widely used in different applications. Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, as embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale recommenders.

| **[iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2025 and WWW2025@HCRS</p></details> |

However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors. Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity. Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies. Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength, offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Intent Discovery to Recognition with Topic Modeling and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11176v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial, particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity. Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem, we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings. Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new customer intents in dynamic domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Generation of Preference Data for Recommendation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating a recommendation system in a controlled environment, to identify specific behaviors and user preferences, requires highly flexible synthetic data generation models capable of mimicking the patterns and trends of real datasets. In this context, we propose HYDRA, a novel preferences data generation model driven by three main factors: user-item interaction level, item popularity, and user engagement level. The key innovations of the proposed process include the ability to generate user communities characterized by similar item adoptions, reflecting real-world social influences and trends. Additionally, HYDRA considers item popularity and user engagement as mixtures of different probability distributions, allowing for a more realistic simulation of diverse scenarios. This approach enhances the model's capacity to simulate a wide range of real-world cases, capturing the complexity and variability found in actual user behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HYDRA through extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets. The results highlight its capability to replicate real-world data patterns, offering valuable insights for developing and testing recommendation systems in a controlled and realistic manner. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/SimoneMungari/HYDRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Item-Language Model for Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02844v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language Models (LLMs) have been extremely successful at tasks like complex dialogue understanding, reasoning and coding due to their emergent abilities. These emergent abilities have been extended with multi-modality to include image, audio, and video capabilities. Recommender systems, on the other hand, have been critical for information seeking and item discovery needs. Recently, there have been attempts to apply LLMs for recommendations. One difficulty of current attempts is that the underlying LLM is usually not trained on the recommender system data, which largely contains user interaction signals and is often not publicly available. Another difficulty is user interaction signals often have a different pattern from natural language text, and it is currently unclear if the LLM training setup can learn more non-trivial knowledge from interaction signals compared with traditional recommender system methods. Finally, it is difficult to train multiple LLMs for different use-cases, and to retain the original language and reasoning abilities when learning from recommender system data. To address these three limitations, we propose an Item-Language Model (ILM), which is composed of an item encoder to produce text-aligned item representations that encode user interaction signals, and a frozen LLM that can understand those item representations with preserved pretrained knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate both the importance of the language-alignment and of user interaction knowledge in the item encoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Who You Are Matters: Bridging Topics and Social Roles via LLM-Enhanced Logical Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10940v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public datasets as verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explain What You Mean: Intent Augmented Knowledge Graph Recommender Built With LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems. Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRAC: Automated Processing-in-Memory Accelerator Design for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10748v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance bottleneck of deep-learning-based recommender systems resides in their backbone Deep Neural Networks. By integrating Processing-In-Memory~(PIM) architectures, researchers can reduce data movement and enhance energy efficiency, paving the way for next-generation recommender models. Nevertheless, achieving performance and efficiency gains is challenging due to the complexity of the PIM design space and the intricate mapping of operators. In this paper, we demonstrate that automated PIM design is feasible even within the most demanding recommender model design space, spanning over $10^{54}$ possible architectures. We propose \methodname, which formulates the co-optimization of recommender models and PIM design as a combinatorial search over mixed-precision interaction operations, and parameterizes the search with a one-shot supernet encompassing all mixed-precision options. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on three Click-Through Rate benchmarks, showcasing the superiority of our automated design methodology over manual approaches. Our results indicate up to a 3.36$\times$ speedup, 1.68$\times$ area reduction, and 12.48$\times$ higher power efficiency compared to naively mapped searched designs and state-of-the-art handcrafted designs.</p></details> | GLSVLSI 2025 |
| **[Diffusion Recommender Models and the Illusion of Progress: A Concerning Study of Reproducibility and a Conceptual Mismatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09364v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n} recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Approximate Biclique Counting over Large Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10471v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Memorize Recommendation Datasets? A Preliminary Study on MovieLens-1M](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have made all the code publicly available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/LLM-MemoryInspector</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards More Efficient, Robust, Instance-adaptive, and Generalizable Sequential Decision making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09192v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |
| **[How Students Use AI Feedback Matters: Experimental Evidence on Physics Achievement and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08672v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the precision and adaptiveness of generative AI (GAI)-powered feedback provided to students, existing practice and literature might ignore how usage patterns impact student learning. This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p < 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p < 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p < 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p < 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p < 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p < 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shallow AutoEncoding Recommender with Cold Start Handling via Side Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02288v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User and item cold starts present significant challenges in industrial applications of recommendation systems. Supplementing user-item interaction data with metadata is a common solution-but often at the cost of introducing additional biases. In this work, we introduce an augmented EASE model that seamlessly integrates both user and item side information to address these cold start issues. Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method produces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold items while refining user representations in data-sparse environments. Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong baseline for future comparative studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing submission to CIKM 2025; 2 Figures; 4 Tables; 13 pages; Python code implementation example</p></details> |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify "high" achievable goals for inference. While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Models in Multimodal Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09777v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Adaptively-weighted Nearest Neighbors for Matrix Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09612v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical note, we introduce and analyze AWNN: an adaptively weighted nearest neighbor method for performing matrix completion. Nearest neighbor (NN) methods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines such as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in panel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very intuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees. However, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate choice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest neighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past two decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii and the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN addresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off inherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the theory via synthetic experiments.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing datasets predominantly focus on Western songs with mood terms derived from English, which may limit generalizability across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. To address this, we introduce `GlobalMood', a novel cross-cultural benchmark dataset comprising 1,180 songs sampled from 59 countries, with large-scale annotations collected from 2,519 individuals across five culturally and linguistically distinct locations: U.S., France, Mexico, S. Korea, and Egypt. Rather than imposing predefined mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related mood terms. We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors. Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain mood terms, despite being dictionary equivalents, are perceived cross-culturally. State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, as evidenced by improved alignment with human evaluations - particularly in non-English contexts. More broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HMamba: Hyperbolic Mamba for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09205v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems have become a cornerstone of personalized services, adept at modeling the temporal evolution of user preferences by capturing dynamic interaction sequences. Existing approaches predominantly rely on traditional models, including RNNs and Transformers. Despite their success in local pattern recognition, Transformer-based methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity and a tendency toward superficial attention patterns, limiting their ability to infer enduring preference hierarchies in sequential recommendation data. Recent advances in Mamba-based sequential models introduce linear-time efficiency but remain constrained by Euclidean geometry, failing to leverage the intrinsic hyperbolic structure of recommendation data. To bridge this gap, we propose Hyperbolic Mamba, a novel architecture that unifies the efficiency of Mamba's selective state space mechanism with hyperbolic geometry's hierarchical representational power. Our framework introduces (1) a hyperbolic selective state space that maintains curvature-aware sequence modeling and (2) stabilized Riemannian operations to enable scalable training. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that Hyperbolic Mamba achieves 3-11% improvement while retaining Mamba's linear-time efficiency, enabling real-world deployment. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient, hierarchy-aware sequential modeling.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly focused on the algorithms, display, and evaluation methodologies of XRS. While current research and reviews primarily emphasize the algorithmic aspects, with fewer studies addressing the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) layer of XRS. Additionally, existing reviews lack a unified taxonomy for XRS and there is insufficient attention given to the emerging area of short video recommendations. In this study, we synthesize existing literature and surveys on XRS, presenting a unified framework for its research and development. The main contributions are as follows: 1) We adopt a lifecycle perspective to systematically summarize the technologies and methods used in XRS, addressing challenges posed by the diversity and complexity of algorithmic models and explanation techniques. 2) For the first time, we highlight the application of multimedia, particularly video-based explanations, along with its potential, technical pathways, and challenges in XRS. 3) We provide a structured overview of evaluation methods from both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. These findings provide valuable insights for the systematic design, progress, and testing of XRS.</p></details> | 2 Tables, 29 figures |

This system intelligently distributes exploration budgets, optimizing for the long-term benefit of the recommendation platform. The impact is a demonstrably more efficient cold-start process, leading to a significant increase in the discoverability of new content and ultimately enriching the item corpus available for exploitation, as evidenced by its successful deployment in a large-scale production environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by the 18th ACM Recsys Large Recsys Workshop</p></details> |

It involves identifying pieces of text that deviate in some way from previously known information. However, novelty is also a crucial determinant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience, as it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors, particularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty and innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and novelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural diversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI), the lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper understanding of these divergences. This gap limits quantifying and understanding cultural differences within computational frameworks. To address this, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that integrates knowledge from sociology and management. Central to our approach is GlobalFusion, a novel dataset comprising 500 dishes and approximately 100,000 cooking recipes capturing cultural adaptation from over 150 countries. By introducing a set of Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics for novelty, we leverage this dataset to analyze textual divergences when recipes from one community are modified by another with a different cultural background. The results reveal significant correlations between our cultural novelty metrics and established cultural measures based on linguistic, religious, and geographical distances. Our findings highlight the potential of our framework to advance the understanding and measurement of cultural diversity in AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to match the version accepted at ACM FAccT 2025.

We present TrialMatchAI, an AI-powered recommendation system that automates patient-to-trial matching by processing heterogeneous clinical data, including structured records and unstructured physician notes. Built on fine-tuned, open-source large language models (LLMs) within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, TrialMatchAI ensures transparency and reproducibility and maintains a lightweight deployment footprint suitable for clinical environments. The system normalizes biomedical entities, retrieves relevant trials using a hybrid search strategy combining lexical and semantic similarity, re-ranks results, and performs criterion-level eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This pipeline delivers explainable outputs with traceable decision rationales. In real-world validation, 92 percent of oncology patients had at least one relevant trial retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized data, enables secure local deployment, and allows seamless replacement of LLM components as more advanced models emerge. By enhancing efficiency and interpretability and offering lightweight, open-source deployment, TrialMatchAI provides a scalable solution for AI-driven clinical trial matching in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interest Changes: Considering User Interest Life Cycle in Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08471v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommendation systems, user interests are always in a state of constant flux. Typically, a user interest experiences a emergent phase, a stable phase, and a declining phase, which are referred to as the "user interest life-cycle". Recent papers on user interest modeling have primarily focused on how to compute the correlation between the target item and user's historical behaviors, without thoroughly considering the life-cycle features of user interest. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Deep Interest Life-cycle Network (DILN), which not only captures the interest life-cycle features efficiently, but can also be easily integrated to existing ranking models. DILN contains two key components: Interest Life-cycle Encoder Module constructs historical activity histograms of the user interest and then encodes them into dense representation. Interest Life-cycle Fusion Module injects the encoded dense representation into multiple expert networks, with the aim of enabling the specific phase of interest life-cycle to activate distinct experts. Online A/B testing reveals that DILN achieves significant improvements of +0.38% in CTR, +1.04% in CVR and +0.25% in duration per user, which demonstrates its effectiveness. In addition, DILN inherently increase the exposure of users' emergent and stable interests while decreasing the exposure of declining interests. DILN has been deployed on the Lofter App.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Today, they are among the most widely used applications of AI and machine learning. Consequently, regulations and guidelines for trustworthy AI, such as the European AI Act, which addresses issues like bias and fairness, are highly relevant to the design, development, and evaluation of recommender systems. One particularly important type of bias in this context is popularity bias, which results in the unfair underrepresentation of less popular content in recommendation lists. This work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of popularity bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector. Analyzing datasets from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime, we demonstrate that an item's recommendation frequency is positively correlated with its popularity. As a result, user groups with little interest in popular content receive less accurate recommendations compared to those who prefer widely popular items. Furthermore, this work contributes to a better understanding of the connection between recommendation accuracy, calibration quality of algorithms, and popularity bias amplification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EWAF'25, summarizes fairness and popularity bias research presented in Dr. Kowald's habilitation: https://domkowald.github.io/documents/others/2024habilitation_recsys.pdf</p></details> |

Concurrently, different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an ''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an ''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238v6)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this challenging problem, we propose an innovative solution called User Interest Enhancement (UIE). UIE enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences by leveraging the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vectors generated based on dynamic streaming clustering of similar users and items from multiple perspectives, which are stored and updated in memory networks. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance for users with sparse interest, but also delivers notable gains for other users. As an end-to-end solution, UIE is easy to implement on top of existing ranking models. Furthermore, we extend our approach to long-tail items using similar methods, which also yields excellent improvements. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in an industrial RS. The results demonstrate that UIE substantially outperforms other existing approaches, especially for users with sparse interest. UIE has been deployed in several large-scale RSs at Tencent since 2022, which was made public on 21 May 2024. In addition, UIE-based methods have also been successfully applied in candidate generation, pre-ranking, and context-DNN stages. Multiple teams have developed solutions based on UIE, focusing on updating clustering algorithms and attention mechanisms. As far as we know, UIE has been applied in multiple RSs, advertising systems and search engines. The thoughts of UIE, dynamic streaming clustering and similarity enhancement, have inspired subsequent relevant works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07431v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems in AI-based medical diagnostics and treatment constitute a critical component of AI in healthcare. Although some studies have explored this area and made notable progress, healthcare recommendation systems remain in their nascent stage. And these researches mainly target the treatment process such as drug or disease recommendations. In addition to the treatment process, the diagnostic process, particularly determining which medical examinations are necessary to evaluate the condition, also urgently requires intelligent decision support. To bridge this gap, we first formalize the task of medical examination recommendations. Compared to traditional recommendations, the medical examination recommendation involves more complex interactions. This complexity arises from two folds: 1) The historical medical records for examination recommendations are heterogeneous and redundant, which makes the recommendation results susceptible to noise. 2) The correlation between the medical history of patients is often irregular, making it challenging to model spatiotemporal dependencies. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Diffusion-driven SpatioTemporal Graph KANsformer for Medical Examination Recommendation (DST-GKAN) with a two-stage learning paradigm to solve the above challenges. In the first stage, we exploit a task-adaptive diffusion model to distill recommendation-oriented information by reducing the noises in heterogeneous medical data. In the second stage, a spatiotemporal graph KANsformer is proposed to simultaneously model the complex spatial and temporal relationships. Moreover, to facilitate the medical examination recommendation research, we introduce a comprehensive dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method compared to various competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences.

To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of accuracy, fairness, and diversity, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems.

| **[DARLR: Dual-Agent Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems with Dynamic Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07257v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for recommender systems, enabling effective policy learning by interacting with frozen world models. However, the reward functions in these world models, trained on sparse offline logs, often suffer from inaccuracies. Specifically, existing methods face two major limitations in addressing this challenge: (1) deterministic use of reward functions as static look-up tables, which propagates inaccuracies during policy learning, and (2) static uncertainty designs that fail to effectively capture decision risks and mitigate the impact of these inaccuracies. In this work, a dual-agent framework, DARLR, is proposed to dynamically update world models to enhance recommendation policies. To achieve this, a \textbf{\textit{selector}} is introduced to identify reference users by balancing similarity and diversity so that the \textbf{\textit{recommender}} can aggregate information from these users and iteratively refine reward estimations for dynamic reward shaping. Further, the statistical features of the selected users guide the dynamic adaptation of an uncertainty penalty to better align with evolving recommendation requirements. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DARLR, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/ArronDZhang/DARLR.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 |
| **[ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13163v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective tool for real-world recommender systems with its capacity to model the dynamic interest of users and its interactive nature. Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods. In this paper, a novel model-based Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, ROLeR, is proposed for reward and uncertainty estimation in recommendation systems. Specifically, a non-parametric reward shaping method is designed to refine the reward model. In addition, a flexible and more representative uncertainty penalty is designed to fit the needs of recommendation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase that ROLeR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

| **[A Generative Re-ranking Model for List-level Multi-objective Optimization at Taobao](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07197v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce recommendation systems aim to generate ordered lists of items for customers, optimizing multiple business objectives, such as clicks, conversions and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Traditional multi-objective optimization methods like formulas or Learning-to-rank (LTR) models take effect at item-level, neglecting dynamic user intent and contextual item interactions. List-level multi-objective optimization in the re-ranking stage can overcome this limitation, but most current re-ranking models focus more on accuracy improvement with context. In addition, re-ranking is faced with the challenges of time complexity and diversity. In light of this, we propose a novel end-to-end generative re-ranking model named Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer-Generator (SORT-Gen) for the less-studied list-level multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, SORT-Gen is divided into two parts: 1)Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer innovatively uses Transformer and ordered regression to accurately estimate multi-objective values for variable-length sub-lists. 2)Mask-Driven Fast Generation Algorithm combines multi-objective candidate queues, efficient item selection and diversity mechanism into model inference, providing a fast online list generation method. Comprehensive online experiments demonstrate that SORT-Gen brings +4.13% CLCK and +8.10% GMV for Baiyibutie, a notable Mini-app of Taobao. Currently, SORT-Gen has been successfully deployed in multiple scenarios of Taobao App, serving for a vast number of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Recommendations using Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06841v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations, delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of loyalty and survival.'' Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and recommendation systems in digital entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IEEE CAI 2025.

| **[RuleGenie: SIEM Detection Rule Set Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06701v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations. Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited, with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction, language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity, evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations' security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language), demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06612v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Robust Recommendation: A Review and an Adversarial Robustness Evaluation Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17844v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, recommender system has achieved significant success. However, due to the openness of recommender systems, they remain vulnerable to malicious attacks. Additionally, natural noise in training data and issues such as data sparsity can also degrade the performance of recommender systems. Therefore, enhancing the robustness of recommender systems has become an increasingly important research topic. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the robustness of recommender systems. Based on our investigation, we categorize the robustness of recommender systems into adversarial robustness and non-adversarial robustness. In the adversarial robustness, we introduce the fundamental principles and classical methods of recommender system adversarial attacks and defenses. In the non-adversarial robustness, we analyze non-adversarial robustness from the perspectives of data sparsity, natural noise, and data imbalance. Additionally, we summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics for evaluating the robustness of recommender systems. Finally, we also discuss the current challenges in the field of recommender system robustness and potential future research directions. Additionally, to facilitate fair and efficient evaluation of attack and defense methods in adversarial robustness, we propose an adversarial robustness evaluation library--ShillingREC, and we conduct evaluations of basic attack models and recommendation models.

| **[Negotiating the Shared Agency between Humans & AI in the Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15919v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart recommendation algorithms have revolutionized content delivery and improved efficiency across various domains. However, concerns about user agency arise from the algorithms' inherent opacity (information asymmetry) and one-way output (power asymmetry). This study introduces a dual-control mechanism aimed at enhancing user agency, empowering users to manage both data collection and, novelly, the degree of algorithmically tailored content they receive. In a between-subject experiment with 161 participants, we evaluated the impact of varying levels of transparency and control on user experience. Results show that transparency alone is insufficient to foster a sense of agency, and may even exacerbate disempowerment compared to displaying outcomes directly. Conversely, combining transparency with user controls-particularly those allowing direct influence on outcomes-significantly enhances user agency. This research provides a proof-of-concept for a novel approach and lays the groundwork for designing more user-centered recommender systems that emphasize user autonomy and fairness in AI-driven content delivery.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a gap between this method and the actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video recommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond merely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true interests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will leads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display advertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem from classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through user viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the study introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario than the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights on how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation and online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core business objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and, consequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison between the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted Logloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient solution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that focuses on a singular objective.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICMI ...</summary><p>ICMI 2025 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence April 05-06, 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  |

Neuro-symbolic approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic learning offer a promising approach toward transparent and user-centric systems. In this work-in-progress, we investigate using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) as a neuro-symbolic approach for recommendations that learn logic-based rules over predefined, human-readable atoms. Each rule corresponds to a fuzzy logic expression, making the recommender's decision process inherently transparent. In contrast to black-box machine learning methods, our approach reveals the reasoning behind a recommendation while maintaining competitive performance. We evaluate our method on a synthetic and MovieLens 1M datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our results demonstrate that our approach accurately captures user behavior while providing a transparent decision-making process. Finally, the differentiable nature of this approach facilitates an integration with other neural models, enabling the development of hybrid, transparent recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the HyPer workshop, co-located with ACM UMAP 2025</p></details> |

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods train Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent with greedy action selection or sampling strategy, and may suffer from suboptimal conversational planning. To address this, we present a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based CRS framework SAPIENT. SAPIENT consists of a conversational agent (S-agent) and a conversational planner (S-planner). S-planner builds a conversational search tree with MCTS based on the initial actions proposed by S-agent to find conversation plans. The best conversation plans from S-planner are used to guide the training of S-agent, creating a self-training loop where S-agent can iteratively improve its capability for conversational planning. Furthermore, we propose an efficient variant SAPIENT for trade-off between training efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that SAPIENT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

By modifying only a small fraction of tokens within item descriptions -- for instance, adding emotional keywords or borrowing phrases from semantically related items -- an attacker can significantly promote or demote targeted items. We formalize these attacks under token-edit and semantic-similarity constraints, and we examine their effectiveness in both promotion (long-tail items) and demotion (short-head items) scenarios. Our experiments on MovieLens, using two large language model (LLM) retrieval modules, show that even subtle attacks shift final rankings and item exposures while eluding naive detection. The results underscore the vulnerability of RAG-based pipelines to small-scale metadata rewrites and emphasize the need for robust textual consistency checks and provenance tracking to thwart stealthy provider-side poisoning.</p></details> |  |

These approaches typically fail to account for the cognitive processes that shape user preferences and decision-making. In this vision paper, we propose a hybrid user modeling framework based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R that integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of human memory. Our goal is to combine ACT-R's declarative memory, which is responsible for storing symbolic chunks along sub-symbolic activations, with its procedural memory, which contains symbolic production rules. This integration will help simulate how users retrieve past experiences and apply decision-making strategies. With this approach, we aim to provide more transparent recommendations, enable rule-based explanations, and facilitate the modeling of cognitive biases. We argue that our approach has the potential to inform the design of a new generation of human-centered, psychology-informed recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the HyPer workshop, co-located with ACM UMAP 2025</p></details> |

However, generative ranking systems are still understudied, particularly with respect to their effectiveness and feasibility in large-scale industrial settings. This paper investigates this topic at the ranking stage of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, a recommender system that serves hundreds of millions of users. Specifically, we first examine how generative ranking outperforms current industrial recommenders. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that the primary improvement in effectiveness stems from the generative architecture, rather than the training paradigm. To facilitate efficient deployment of generative ranking, we introduce GenRank, a novel generative architecture for ranking. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution through online A/B experiments. The results show that GenRank achieves significant improvements in user satisfaction with nearly equivalent computational resources compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |

Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25), June 16--19, 2025, New York City, NY, USA Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Group Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (GMAP), co-located at UMAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Item Representations Directly from Multimodal Features for Effective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04960v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multimodal recommender systems predominantly leverage Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization to learn item representations by amalgamating item identity (ID) embeddings with multimodal features. Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/enoche/LIRDRec</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.</p></details> |  |

The transport network - responsible for interconnecting the radio access network and core networks - will increasingly face challenges in efficiently managing complex traffic patterns. The Network Digital Twin (NDT) concept emerges as a promising solution for testing configurations and algorithms in a virtual network before real-world deployment. In this context, this work designs an experimental platform with NDT in a transport network domain, synchronizing with the virtual counterpart and a recommendation system for what-if analysis, enabling intelligent decision-making for dynamic route optimization problems in 5G/B5G scenarios. Our NDT, composed of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), was evaluated across three different network topologies consisting of 8, 16, and 30 nodes. It achieved lower MAPE values for URLLC and eMBB slices, comparing latency predictions with actual latency after the solution implementation. These values indicate high accuracy, demonstrating the solution's effectiveness in generating precise insights into network performance if a particular solution were implemented.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE International Conference on Communications. \c{opyright}2025 IEEE.

However, the inherent exchange of information between agents and their interaction with external environments, such as LLM, tools, and users, inevitably introduces significant risks of sensitive data leakage, including vulnerabilities to attacks like prompt injection and reconnaissance. Existing MACS fail to enable privacy controls, making it challenging to manage sensitive information securely. In this paper, we take the first step to address the MACS's data leakage threat at the system development level through a privacy-enhanced development paradigm, Maris. Maris enables rigorous message flow control within MACS by embedding reference monitors into key multi-agent conversation components. We implemented Maris as an integral part of AutoGen, a widely adopted open-source multi-agent development framework. Then, we evaluate Maris for its effectiveness and performance overhead on privacy-critical MACS use cases, including healthcare, supply chain optimization, and personalized recommendation system. The result shows that Maris achieves satisfactory effectiveness, performance overhead and practicability for adoption.</p></details> |  |

Such documentation and analysis provide guidance and context for designing and evaluating recommender systems, particularly for evaluation designs making use of time (e.g., temporal splitting). In this paper, we present a temporal explanatory analysis of the UCSD Book Graph dataset scraped from Goodreads, a social reading and recommendation platform active since 2006. We measure the book interaction data using a set of activity, diversity, and fairness metrics; we then train a set of collaborative filtering algorithms on rolling training windows to observe how the same measures evolve over time in the recommendations. Additionally, we explore whether the introduction of algorithmic recommendations in 2011 was followed by observable changes in user or recommender system behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.</p></details> |  |
| **[With Friends Like These, Who Needs Explanations? Evaluating User Understanding of Group Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04273v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Recommender Systems (GRS) employing social choice-based aggregation strategies have previously been explored in terms of perceived consensus, fairness, and satisfaction. At the same time, the impact of textual explanations has been examined, but the results suggest a low effectiveness of these explanations. However, user understanding remains fairly unexplored, even if it can contribute positively to transparent GRS. This is particularly interesting to study in more complex or potentially unfair scenarios when user preferences diverge, such as in a minority scenario (where group members have similar preferences, except for a single member in a minority position). In this paper, we analyzed the impact of different types of explanations on user understanding of group recommendations. We present a randomized controlled trial (n = 271) using two between-subject factors: (i) the aggregation strategy (additive, least misery, and approval voting), and (ii) the modality of explanation (no explanation, textual explanation, or multimodal explanation). We measured both subjective (self-perceived by the user) and objective understanding (performance on model simulation, counterfactuals and error detection). In line with recent findings on explanations for machine learning models, our results indicate that more detailed explanations, whether textual or multimodal, did not increase subjective or objective understanding. However, we did find a significant effect of aggregation strategies on both subjective and objective understanding. These results imply that when constructing GRS, practitioners need to consider that the choice of aggregation strategy can influence the understanding of users. Post-hoc analysis also suggests that there is value in analyzing performance on different tasks, rather than through a single aggregated metric of understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will be part of the UMAP 2025 conference.

| **[Modeling Domain and Feedback Transitions for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08209v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, many recommender systems encompass various domains to cater to users' diverse needs, leading to user behaviors transitioning across different domains. In fact, user behaviors across different domains reveal changes in preference toward recommended items. For instance, a shift from negative feedback to positive feedback indicates improved user satisfaction. However, existing cross-domain sequential recommendation methods typically model user interests by focusing solely on information about domain transitions, often overlooking the valuable insights provided by users' feedback transitions. In this paper, we propose $\text{Transition}^2$, a novel method to model transitions across both domains and types of user feedback. Specifically, $\text{Transition}^2$ introduces a transition-aware graph encoder based on user history, assigning different weights to edges according to the feedback type. This enables the graph encoder to extract historical embeddings that capture the transition information between different domains and feedback types. Subsequently, we encode the user history using a cross-transition multi-head self-attention, incorporating various masks to distinguish different types of transitions. To further enhance representation learning, we employ contrastive losses to align transitions across domains and feedback types. Finally, we integrate these modules to make predictions across different domains. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{Transition}^2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Risks and Regulatory Strategies of Large Language Models in Digital Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04665v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, we assess generated outputs through a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training)-based similarity, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), FID (Frechet Inception Distance), and retrieval-based measures, as well as qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate that structured metadata enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures. While not a traditional recommender system, our framework enables task-specific recommendations for model selection and prompt design based on evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03655v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Familiarizing with Music: Discovery Patterns for Different Music Discovery Needs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03568v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans have the tendency to discover and explore. This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs. Our findings open up possibilities to infer users' interest in unfamiliar music from streaming data as well as possibilities to develop recommender systems that guide users in exploring music in a more natural way.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Adjun...</summary><p>Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP Adjunct '25)</p></details> |

In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Adjun...</summary><p>Adjunct Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization</p></details> |
| **[Variable projection framework for the reduced-rank matrix approximation problem by weighted least-squares](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03347v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this monograph, we review and develop variable projection Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt and Newton methods for the Weighted Low-Rank Approximation (WLRA) problem, which has now an increasing number of applications in many scientific fields. Particular attention is drawn at the robustness, efficiency and scalability of these variable projection second-order algorithms such that they can be used also on larger datasets now commonly found in many practical problems for which only first-order algorithms based on sequential repetitions of local optimization (e.g., majorization, Expectation-Maximization or alternating least-squares methods) or variations of gradient descent (e.g., conjugate, proximal or stochastic gradient descent methods), or hybrid algorithms from these two classes of methods, were only feasible due to their lower cost and memory requirement per iteration. In parallel with this review of variable projection algorithms, we develop new formulae for the Jacobian and Hessian matrices involved in these variable projection methods and demonstrate their very specific properties such as the uniform rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix or the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix at the (local) minimizers of the cost function associated with the WLRA problem. These systematic deficiencies must be taken into account in any practical implementations of the algorithms. These different properties and the very particular geometry of the WLRA problem have not been well appreciated in the past and have been the main obstacles in the development of robust variable projection second-order algorithms for solving the WLRA problem. In addition, we demonstrate that the variable projection framework gives original insights on the solvability, the landscape and the non-smoothness of the WLRA problem. It also helps to describe the tight links between previously unrelated methods, which have been proposed to solve it. Specifically, we illustrate the closed links between the variable projection framework and Riemannian optimization on the Grassmann manifold for the WLRA problem. We expect that software's developers and practitioners in different fields such as computer vision, signal processing, recommender systems, machine learning, multivariate statistics and geophysical sciences will benefit from the results in this monograph in order to devise more robust and accurate algorithms to solve the WLRA problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Recommending Out-of-Domain Items: Constrained Generative Recommendation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03336v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11225v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that can capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an increasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation systems, the cold-start problem caused by interaction sparsity has been impacting the effectiveness of recommendations for cold-start items. Many cold-start scheme based on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on offline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online recommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method, computational overhead and time constraints. Inspired by the above questions, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware Meta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming data settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks by predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and reweight behavior-related and content-related features in each task based on their different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to recommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly reduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods. Furthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional self-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging insights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing cold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, published in KDD '25</p></details> |
| **[Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03382v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalization of Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00027v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become increasingly important with a wide range of applications. Despite the importance and recent progress, most existing works on personalized LLMs have focused either entirely on (a) personalized text generation or (b) leveraging LLMs for personalization-related downstream applications, such as recommendation systems. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two separate main directions for the first time by introducing a taxonomy for personalized LLM usage and summarizing the key differences and challenges. We provide a formalization of the foundations of personalized LLMs that consolidates and expands notions of personalization of LLMs, defining and discussing novel facets of personalization, usage, and desiderata of personalized LLMs. We then unify the literature across these diverse fields and usage scenarios by proposing systematic taxonomies for the granularity of personalization, personalization techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and applications of personalized LLMs. Finally, we highlight challenges and important open problems that remain to be addressed. By unifying and surveying recent research using the proposed taxonomies, we aim to provide a clear guide to the existing literature and different facets of personalization in LLMs, empowering both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms. We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source. The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty in Repeated Implicit Feedback as a Measure of Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02492v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems rely heavily on user feedback to learn effective user and item representations. Despite their widespread adoption, limited attention has been given to the uncertainty inherent in the feedback used to train these systems. Both implicit and explicit feedback are prone to noise due to the variability in human interactions, with implicit feedback being particularly challenging. In collaborative filtering, the reliability of interaction signals is critical, as these signals determine user and item similarities. Thus, deriving accurate confidence measures from implicit feedback is essential for ensuring the reliability of these signals. A common assumption in academia and industry is that repeated interactions indicate stronger user interest, increasing confidence in preference estimates. However, in domains such as music streaming, repeated consumption can shift user preferences over time due to factors like satiation and exposure. While literature on repeated consumption acknowledges these dynamics, they are often overlooked when deriving confidence scores for implicit feedback. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on music streaming, where repeated interactions are frequent and quantifiable. We analyze how repetition patterns intersect with key factors influencing user interest and develop methods to quantify the associated uncertainty. These uncertainty measures are then integrated as consistency metrics in a recommendation task. Our empirical results show that incorporating uncertainty into user preference models yields more accurate and relevant recommendations. Key contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty in repeated consumption patterns, the release of a novel dataset, and a Bayesian model for implicit listening feedback.</p></details> |  |

Current video recommendation models primarily treat each video as a whole, overlooking the dynamic nature of user preferences with specific video segments. In contrast, our research focuses on segment-level user interest modeling, which is crucial for understanding how users' preferences evolve during video browsing. To capture users' dynamic segment interests, we propose an innovative model that integrates a hybrid representation module, a multi-modal user-video encoder, and a segment interest decoder. Our model addresses the challenges of capturing dynamic interest patterns, missing segment-level labels, and fusing different modalities, achieving precise segment-level interest prediction. We present two downstream tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our segment interest modeling approach: video-skip prediction and short video recommendation. Our experiments on real-world short video datasets with diverse modalities show promising results on both tasks. It demonstrates that segment-level interest modeling brings a deep understanding of user engagement and enhances video recommendations. We also release a unique dataset that includes segment-level video data and diverse user behaviors, enabling further research in segment-level interest modeling. This work pioneers a novel perspective on understanding user segment-level preference, offering the potential for more personalized and engaging short video experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods often lack a clear definition of similar users and face challenges when users with unique preferences lack appropriate neighbors. In such cases, relying on divergent preferences of misidentified neighbors can degrade recommendation quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive Collaborative Combinatorial Bandits algorithm (CoCoB). CoCoB employs an innovative two-sided bandit architecture, applying bandit principles to both the user and item sides. The user-bandit employs an enhanced Bayesian model to explore user similarity, identifying neighbors based on a similarity probability threshold. The item-bandit treats items as arms, generating diverse recommendations informed by the user-bandit's output. CoCoB dynamically adapts, leveraging neighbor preferences when available or focusing solely on the target user otherwise. Regret analysis under a linear contextual bandit setting and experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CoCoB's effectiveness, achieving an average 2.4% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by DASFAA 2025: The International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications.

| **[Minimally Supervised Hierarchical Domain Intent Learning for CRS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02209v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling domain intent within an evolving domain structure presents a significant challenge for domain-specific conversational recommendation systems (CRS). The conventional approach involves training an intent model using utterance-intent pairs. However, as new intents and patterns emerge, the model must be continuously updated while preserving existing relationships and maintaining efficient retrieval. This process leads to substantial growth in utterance-intent pairs, making manual labeling increasingly costly and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution for constructing a dynamic hierarchical structure that minimizes the number of user utterances required to achieve adequate domain knowledge coverage. To this end, we introduce a neural network-based attention-driven hierarchical clustering algorithm designed to optimize intent grouping using minimal data. The proposed method builds upon and integrates concepts from two existing flat clustering algorithms DEC and NAM, both of which utilize neural attention mechanisms. We apply our approach to a curated subset of 44,000 questions from the business food domain. Experimental results demonstrate that constructing the hierarchy using a stratified sampling strategy significantly reduces the number of questions needed to represent the evolving intent structure. Our findings indicate that this approach enables efficient coverage of dynamic domain knowledge without frequent retraining, thereby enhancing scalability and adaptability in domain-specific CSRs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research is funded by the National Institution of Food and Agriculture U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA)</p></details> |
| **[Tricolore: Multi-Behavior User Profiling for Enhanced Candidate Generation in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02120v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online platforms aggregate extensive user feedback across diverse behaviors, providing a rich source for enhancing user engagement. Traditional recommender systems, however, typically optimize for a single target behavior and represent user preferences with a single vector, limiting their ability to handle multiple important behaviors or optimization objectives. This conventional approach also struggles to capture the full spectrum of user interests, resulting in a narrow item pool during candidate generation. To address these limitations, we present Tricolore, a versatile multi-vector learning framework that uncovers connections between different behavior types for more robust candidate generation. Tricolore's adaptive multi-task structure is also customizable to specific platform needs. To manage the variability in sparsity across behavior types, we incorporate a behavior-wise multi-view fusion module that dynamically enhances learning. Moreover, a popularity-balanced strategy ensures the recommendation list balances accuracy with item popularity, fostering diversity and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate Tricolore's effectiveness across various recommendation scenarios, from short video platforms to e-commerce. By leveraging a shared base embedding strategy, Tricolore also significantly improves the performance for cold-start users.

| **[Wide & Deep Learning for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02020v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Transformer-based SRS have achieved distinguished successes recently. However, studies reveal self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based models is essentially a low-pass filter and ignores high frequency information potentially including meaningful user interest patterns. This motivates us to seek better filtering technologies for SRS, and finally we find Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a famous time-frequency analysis technique from digital signal processing field, can effectively process both low-frequency and high-frequency information. We design an adaptive time-frequency filter with DWT technique, which decomposes user interests into multiple signals with different frequency and time, and can automatically learn weights of these signals. Furthermore, we develop DWTRec, a model for sequential recommendation all based on the adaptive time-frequency filter. Thanks to fast DWT technique, DWTRec has a lower time complexity and space complexity theoretically, and is Proficient in modeling long sequences. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in datasets with different domains, sparsity levels and average sequence lengths. Especially, our model shows great performance increase in contrast with previous models when the sequence grows longer, which demonstrates another advantage of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages, accepted by ICIC 2025 oral</p></details> |

However, most recommendation engines rely primarily on numerical scores, often overlooking the nuanced opinions embedded in free text. This paper comprehensively reviews sentiment-aware recommendation systems from a natural language processing perspective, covering advancements from 2023 to early 2025. It highlights the benefits of integrating sentiment analysis into e-commerce recommenders to enhance prediction accuracy and explainability through detailed opinion extraction. Our survey categorizes recent work into four main approaches: deep learning classifiers that combine sentiment embeddings with user item interactions, transformer based methods for nuanced feature extraction, graph neural networks that propagate sentiment signals, and conversational recommenders that adapt in real time to user feedback. We summarize model architectures and demonstrate how sentiment flows through recommendation pipelines, impacting dialogue-based suggestions. Key challenges include handling noisy or sarcastic text, dynamic user preferences, and bias mitigation. Finally, we outline research gaps and provide a roadmap for developing smarter, fairer, and more user-centric recommendation tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we evaluate MAP using a sequential rating prediction task under two scenarios: single domain, where memory and tasks are from the same category (e.g., movies), and cross-domain (e.g., memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Our Columns Selected Matrix Completion (CSMC) method combines Column Subset Selection and Low-Rank Matrix Completion to efficiently reconstruct incomplete datasets. In each step, CSMC solves a convex optimization problem. We introduce two algorithms to implement CSMC, each tailored to problems of different sizes. A formal analysis is provided, outlining the necessary assumptions and the probability of obtaining a correct solution. To assess the impact of matrix size, rank, and the ratio of missing entries on solution quality and computation time, we conducted experiments on synthetic data. The method was also applied to two real-world problems: recommendation systems and image inpainting. Our results show that CSMC provides solutions of the same quality as state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms based on convex optimization, while achieving significant reductions in computational runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the hub graphical Lasso model with the structured sparsity via an efficient algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08852v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks. We fully excavate the sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian arising from the hubs in the graphical models, which ensures that the algorithm can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a high-quality estimation.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Guided Recommendations of Energy-Efficient Networks), a novel, inference-time approach for recommending Pareto-optimal AI model configurations that optimize validation performance and energy consumption across diverse AI domains and tasks. Our approach directly addresses the limitations of current eco-efficient neural architecture search methods, which are often restricted to specific architectures or tasks. Central to this work is EcoTaskSet, a dataset comprising training dynamics from over 1767 experiments across computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems using both widely used and cutting-edge architectures. Leveraging this dataset and a prediction model, our approach demonstrates effectiveness in selecting the best model configuration based on user preferences. Experimental results show that our method successfully identifies energy-efficient configurations while ensuring competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-agents based User Values Mining for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00981v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have rapidly evolved and become integral to many online services. However, existing systems sometimes produce unstable and unsatisfactory recommendations that fail to align with users' fundamental and long-term preferences. This is because they primarily focus on extracting shallow and short-term interests from user behavior data, which is inherently dynamic and challenging to model. Unlike these transient interests, user values are more stable and play a crucial role in shaping user behaviors, such as purchasing items and consuming content. Incorporating user values into recommender systems can help stabilize recommendation performance and ensure results better reflect users' latent preferences. However, acquiring user values is typically difficult and costly. To address this challenge, we leverage the strong language understanding, zero-shot inference, and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract user values from users' historical interactions. Unfortunately, direct extraction using LLMs presents several challenges such as length constraints and hallucination. To overcome these issues, we propose ZOOM, a zero-shot multi-LLM collaborative framework for effective and accurate user value extraction. In ZOOM, we apply text summarization techniques to condense item content while preserving essential meaning. To mitigate hallucinations, ZOOM introduces two specialized agent roles: evaluators and supervisors, to collaboratively generate accurate user values. Extensive experiments on two widely used recommendation datasets with two state-of-the-art recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework in automatic user value mining and recommendation performance improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing User Sequence Modeling through Barlow Twins-based Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00953v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User sequence modeling is crucial for modern large-scale recommendation systems, as it enables the extraction of informative representations of users and items from their historical interactions. These user representations are widely used for a variety of downstream tasks to enhance users' online experience. A key challenge for learning these representations is the lack of labeled training data. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as a promising solution for learning representations from unlabeled data, many existing approaches rely on extensive negative sampling, which can be computationally expensive and may not always be feasible in real-world scenario. In this work, we propose an adaptation of Barlow Twins, a state-of-the-art SSL methods, to user sequence modeling by incorporating suitable augmentation methods. Our approach aims to mitigate the need for large negative sample batches, enabling effective representation learning with smaller batch sizes and limited labeled data. We evaluate our method on the MovieLens-1M, MovieLens-20M, and Yelp datasets, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms the widely-used dual encoder model across three downstream tasks, achieving an 8%-20% improvement in accuracy. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of our approach in extracting valuable sequence-level information for user modeling, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and negative examples are limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Privacy and Utility in LLM-Based Product Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00951v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems leverage powerful language models to generate personalized suggestions by processing user interactions and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on structured data and collaborative filtering, LLM-based models process textual and contextual information, often using cloud-based infrastructure. This raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to remote servers, increasing the risk of exposure and reducing control over personal information. To address this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving recommendation framework which separates sensitive from nonsensitive data and only shares the latter with the cloud to harness LLM-powered recommendations. To restore lost recommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a de-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves almost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with an LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to obfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category distribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, our method runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, making privacy-aware LLM-based recommendation systems practical for real-world use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Temporal User Profiling with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00886v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling user preferences is vital not only for improving recommendation performance but also for enhancing transparency in recommender systems. Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |

Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

| **[A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection.

Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

Studies were selected based on their use of NLP to address medically inaccurate information and were categorized by topic, tasks, document types, datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. Results: NLP has shown potential in addressing medically inaccurate information on the following tasks: (1) error detection (2) error correction (3) misinformation detection (4) misinformation correction (5) hallucination detection (6) hallucination mitigation. However, challenges remain with data privacy, context dependency, and evaluation standards. Conclusion: This review highlights the advancements in applying NLP to tackle medically inaccurate information while underscoring the need to address persistent challenges.

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

| **[Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unmasking Digital Falsehoods: A Comparative Analysis of LLM-Based Misinformation Detection Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00724v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[E2LVLM:Evidence-Enhanced Large Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10455v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive advancements in multimodal Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation detection, discerning whether an authentic image is wrongly used in a claim. Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |

We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators.

| **[Attacking Misinformation Detection Using Adversarial Examples Generated by Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20940v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061v2)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much quicker than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation models need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalisation, an understudied problem in existing datasets. We identify 6 axes of generalisation-time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type-and design evaluation procedures for each. We also analyse some baseline models, highlighting how these fail important desiderata.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection by Learning from Synthetic Data with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19656v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting multimodal misinformation, especially in the form of image-text pairs, is crucial. Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |
| **[Multi-modal Misinformation Detection: Approaches, Challenges and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13883v7)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As social media platforms are evolving from text-based forums into multi-modal environments, the nature of misinformation in social media is also transforming accordingly. Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpMis: An Investigation of Synthetic Spoken Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11308v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, speech generation technology has advanced rapidly, fueled by generative models and large-scale training techniques. While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Logic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05964v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation on online social platforms is becoming a critical concern due to increasing credibility and easier dissemination brought by multimedia content, compared to traditional text-only information. While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

| **[Exploring the Role of Audio in Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12558v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of deepfake technology, especially the deep audio fake technology, misinformation detection on the social media scene meets a great challenge. Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web. Our experiments show promising results while highlighting several open challenges in retrieval and reasoning.

| **[Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PACIS 2024. 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[ConspEmoLLM: Conspiracy Theory Detection Using an Emotion-Based Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06765v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance.

Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Similarity over Factuality: Are we making progress on multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13488v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field.

| **[A Survey of Datasets for Information Diffusion Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05161v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information diffusion across various new media platforms gradually influences perceptions, decisions, and social behaviors of individual users. In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</p></details> |  |

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Examination on the Effectiveness of Divide-and-Conquer Prompting in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05359v6)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |

Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAEmoLLM: Retrieval Augmented LLMs for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection Using In-Context Learning based on Emotional Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11093v1)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the highest increases of 20.69%, 23.94%, and 39.11% respectively. This work will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Missci: Reconstructing Fallacies in Misrepresented Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03181v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |

Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Capabilities of LLMs across Scale and Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03146v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of LLMs, resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying misleading versus non-misleading news headlines. Utilizing a dataset of 60 articles, sourced from both reputable and questionable outlets across health, science & tech, and business domains, we employ three LLMs- ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini-for classification. Our analysis reveals significant variance in model performance, with ChatGPT-4 demonstrating superior accuracy, especially in cases with unanimous annotator agreement on misleading headlines. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered evaluation in developing LLMs that can navigate the complexities of misinformation detection, aligning technical proficiency with nuanced human judgment. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI ethics, emphasizing the need for models that are not only technically advanced but also ethically aligned and sensitive to the subtleties of human interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 tables, 1st HEAL Workshop at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 12, Honolulu, HI, USA 2024</p></details> |

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective. Additionally, we provide a dataset on health misinformation, thoroughly annotated by experts utilizing our proposed scheme. Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-CoLING-2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</p></details> |  |

However, it is uncertain how the public may react to labels by automated fact-checkers. In this study, we investigate the use of automated warning labels derived from misinformation detection literature and investigate their effects on three forms of post engagement. Focusing on political posts, we also consider how partisanship affects engagement. In a two-phases within-subjects experiment with 200 participants, we found that the generic warnings suppressed intents to comment on and share posts, but not on the intent to like them. Furthermore, when different reasons for the labels were provided, their effects on post engagement were inconsistent, suggesting that the reasons could have undesirably motivated engagement instead. Partisanship effects were observed across the labels with higher engagement for politically congruent posts. We discuss the implications on the design and use of automated warning labels.</p></details> |  |

Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024</p></details> |

At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at K-CAP'23: The 12th Knowledge Capture Conference</p></details> |

Considerable efforts have focused on building misinformation detection models, still the perils of misinformation remain abound. Mitigating online misinformation and its ramifications requires a holistic approach that encompasses not only an understanding of its intricate landscape in relation to the complex issue and topic-rich information ecosystem online, but also the psychological drivers of individuals behind it. Adopting a time series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we conduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19 tweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the behavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19 and its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing misinformation on Non-COVID domains before the pandemic. Our analysis underscores the intricacies inherent to cross-domain misinformation, and highlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is positively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation sharing on emergent topics and beyond.

However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighting Fire with Fire: Adversarial Prompting to Generate a Misinformation Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04481v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success in language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Bard, Llama etc., can potentially lead to concerns about their possible misuse in inducing mass agitation and communal hatred via generating fake news and spreading misinformation. Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities, false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for the task of misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Resolution in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01197v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and distorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information. We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection in a South African Social Media Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04052v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments. Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence Research.

The expertly curated dataset includes annotations for 5,952 tweets, assessing their relevance to COVID-19 vaccines, presence of misinformation, and the themes of the misinformation. To address challenges posed by domain specificity, the low-resource setting, and data imbalance, we adopt two approaches for developing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation detection models: domain-specific pre-training and text augmentation using a large language model. Our best misinformation detection models demonstrate improvements ranging from 2.7 to 15.9 percentage points in macro F1-score compared to the baseline models. Additionally, we apply our misinformation detection models in a large-scale study of 19 million unlabeled tweets from the three countries between 2020 and 2022, showcasing the practical application of our dataset and models for detecting and analyzing vaccine misinformation in multiple countries and languages. Our analysis indicates that percentage changes in the number of new COVID-19 cases are positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rates in a staggered manner for Brazil and Indonesia, and there are significant positive associations between the misinformation rates across the three countries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Main conference), 9 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robust Domain Misinformation Detection via Multi-modal Feature Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14315v1)** | 2023-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher "credibility" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model. The formal implementation of this paper can be found in this link: https://github.com/less-and-less-bugs/RDCM</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TIFS 2023</p></details> |

However, the huge volumes of misinformation (e.g., fake news and rumors) that flood the internet can adversely affect people's lives, and have resulted in the emergence of rumor and fake news detection as a hot research topic. The emotions and sentiments of netizens, as expressed in social media posts and news, constitute important factors that can help to distinguish fake news from genuine news and to understand the spread of rumors. This article comprehensively reviews emotion-based methods for misinformation detection. We begin by explaining the strong links between emotions and misinformation. We subsequently provide a detailed analysis of a range of misinformation detection methods that employ a variety of emotion, sentiment and stance-based features, and describe their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss a number of ongoing challenges in emotion-based misinformation detection based on large language models and suggest future research directions, including data collection (multi-platform, multilingual), annotation, benchmark, multimodality, and interpretability.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

Fake news has become increasingly common, especially in regional languages like Malayalam, due to the rapid publication and lack of editorial standards on some online sites. Fake news may have a terrible effect on society, causing people to make bad judgments, lose faith in authorities, and even engage in violent behavior. When we take into the context of India, there are many regional languages, and fake news is spreading in every language. Therefore, providing efficient techniques for identifying false information in regional tongues is crucial. Until now, little to no work has been done in Malayalam, extracting features from multiple modalities to classify fake news. Multimodal approaches are more accurate in detecting fake news, as features from multiple modalities are extracted to build the deep learning classification model. As far as we know, this is the first piece of work in Malayalam that uses multimodal deep learning to tackle false information. Models trained with more than one modality typically outperform models taught with only one modality. Our study in the Malayalam language utilizing multimodal deep learning is a significant step toward more effective misinformation detection and mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Risk of Misinformation Pollution with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13661v2)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the potential misuse of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating credible-sounding misinformation and its subsequent impact on information-intensive applications, particularly Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) systems. We establish a threat model and simulate potential misuse scenarios, both unintentional and intentional, to assess the extent to which LLMs can be utilized to produce misinformation. Our study reveals that LLMs can act as effective misinformation generators, leading to a significant degradation in the performance of ODQA systems. To mitigate the harm caused by LLM-generated misinformation, we explore three defense strategies: prompting, misinformation detection, and majority voting. While initial results show promising trends for these defensive strategies, much more work needs to be done to address the challenge of misinformation pollution. Our work highlights the need for further research and interdisciplinary collaboration to address LLM-generated misinformation and to promote responsible use of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2023 (Findings; Long Paper)</p></details> |
| **[Online Auditing of Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14595v1)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern social media platforms play an important role in facilitating rapid dissemination of information through their massive user networks. Fake news, misinformation, and unverifiable facts on social media platforms propagate disharmony and affect society. In this paper, we consider the problem of online auditing of information flow/propagation with the goal of classifying news items as fake or genuine. Specifically, driven by experiential studies on real-world social media platforms, we propose a probabilistic Markovian information spread model over networks modeled by graphs. We then formulate our inference task as a certain sequential detection problem with the goal of minimizing the combination of the error probability and the time it takes to achieve correct decision. For this model, we find the optimal detection algorithm minimizing the aforementioned risk and prove several statistical guarantees. We then test our algorithm over real-world datasets. To that end, we first construct an offline algorithm for learning the probabilistic information spreading model, and then apply our optimal detection algorithm. Experimental study show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms in terms of accuracy and detection time.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[VERITE: A Robust Benchmark for Multimodal Misinformation Detection Accounting for Unimodal Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14133v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia content has become ubiquitous on social media platforms, leading to the rise of multimodal misinformation (MM) and the urgent need for effective strategies to detect and prevent its spread. In recent years, the challenge of multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) has garnered significant attention by researchers and has mainly involved the creation of annotated, weakly annotated, or synthetically generated training datasets, along with the development of various deep learning MMD models. However, the problem of unimodal bias has been overlooked, where specific patterns and biases in MMD benchmarks can result in biased or unimodal models outperforming their multimodal counterparts on an inherently multimodal task; making it difficult to assess progress. In this study, we systematically investigate and identify the presence of unimodal bias in widely-used MMD benchmarks, namely VMU-Twitter and COSMOS. To address this issue, we introduce the "VERification of Image-TExt pairs" (VERITE) benchmark for MMD which incorporates real-world data, excludes "asymmetric multimodal misinformation" and utilizes "modality balancing". We conduct an extensive comparative study with a Transformer-based architecture that shows the ability of VERITE to effectively address unimodal bias, rendering it a robust evaluation framework for MMD. Furthermore, we introduce a new method -- termed Crossmodal HArd Synthetic MisAlignment (CHASMA) -- for generating realistic synthetic training data that preserve crossmodal relations between legitimate images and false human-written captions. By leveraging CHASMA in the training process, we observe consistent and notable improvements in predictive performance on VERITE; with a 9.2% increase in accuracy.

This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the sensitivity of open-domain QA models to corpus pollution with misinformation documents. We curate both human-written and model-generated false documents that we inject into the evidence corpus of QA models and assess the impact on the performance of these systems. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable to even small amounts of evidence contamination brought by misinformation, with large absolute performance drops on all models. Misinformation attack brings more threat when fake documents are produced at scale by neural models or the attacker targets hacking specific questions of interest. To defend against such a threat, we discuss the necessity of building a misinformation-aware QA system that integrates question-answering and misinformation detection in a joint fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>AACL-...</summary><p>AACL-IJCNLP 2023 (main conference, long paper)</p></details> |

But many questions remain, including whether open-source models match closed ones, why these models excel or struggle with certain tasks, and what types of practical procedures can improve performance. We address these questions in the context of classification by evaluating three classes of models using eight datasets across three distinct tasks: named entity recognition, political party prediction, and misinformation detection. While larger LLMs often lead to improved performance, open-source models can rival their closed-source counterparts by fine-tuning. Moreover, supervised smaller models, like RoBERTa, can achieve similar or even greater performance in many datasets compared to generative LLMs. On the other hand, closed models maintain an advantage in hard tasks that demand the most generalizability.

In the context of COVID-19 misinformation detection, we conduct an in-the-wild audit of multiple datasets and demonstrate that models trained with several prominently cited recent datasets are vulnerable to anticontent when evaluated in the wild. Second, we present a novel active learning pipeline that requires zero manual annotation and iteratively augments the training data with challenging anticontent, robustifying these classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at AAAI 2023 (Robust and Safe AI track)</p></details> |

It is frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the linguistic signs that matter.</p></details> |  |

(Bridging Theory and Practice of LMO-based Optimizers for LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13416v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements, offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency, better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training. However, a significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025). Our experiments with NanoGPT and CNN confirm that our assumption holds along the optimization trajectory, ultimately closing the gap between theory and practice.</p></details> |  |

Constructing a math KG using natural language is an essential but challenging task. There are two major limitations of existing works: first, they are constrained by corpus completeness, often discarding or manually supplementing incomplete knowledge; second, they typically fail to fully automate the integration of diverse knowledge sources. This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhancing entities and relationships with large language models (LLMs) via in-context learning for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies using SBERT. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge completion mechanism, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG, providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion mechanism, MathVD is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to merge with a candidate or add as a new entity. A wide range of experiments demonstrate the advanced performance and broad applicability of the AutoMathKG system, including superior reachability query results in MathVD compared to five baselines and robust mathematical reasoning capability in Math LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinkless: LLM Learns When to Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13379v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability. Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO. Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Thinkless</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel, decentralized framework for robots to request and provide help. The framework begins with robots detecting conflicts using a Vision Language Model (VLM), then reasoning over whether help is needed. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a natural language (NL) help request using a Large Language Model (LLM). Potential helper robots reason over the request and offer help (if able), along with information about impact to their current tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar to guarantee syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot chooses a helper by reasoning over impact on the overall system. We evaluate our system via experiments considering different strategies for choosing a helper, and find that a requester robot can minimize overall time impact on the system by considering multiple help offers versus simple heuristics (e.g., selecting the nearest robot to help).</p></details> |  |

While such networks are traditionally constructed using embeddings from encoder-based models or static vectors, embeddings from decoder-only large language models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Unlike encoder models, LLMs are trained with a next-token prediction objective, which does not directly encode the meaning of the current token. In this paper, we construct lexico-semantic networks from the input embeddings of LLMs with varying parameter scales and conduct a comparative analysis of their global and local structures. Our results show that these networks exhibit small-world properties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. Moreover, larger LLMs yield more intricate networks with less small-world effects and longer paths, reflecting richer semantic structures and relations. We further validate our approach through analyses of common conceptual pairs, structured lexical relations derived from WordNet, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words.</p></details> | Paper under review |

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification, showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge Architectures to Prompt-Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13348v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns. This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies: Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based assessment frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Thinking Short and Right Over Thinking Long: Serving LLM Reasoning Efficiently and Accurately](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13326v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in test-time scaling suggest that Large Language Models (LLMs) can gain better capabilities by generating Chain-of-Thought reasoning (analogous to human thinking) to respond a given request, and meanwhile exploring more reasoning branches (i.e., generating multiple responses and ensembling them) can improve the final output quality. However, when incorporating the two scaling dimensions, we find that the system efficiency is dampened significantly for two reasons. Firstly, the time cost to generate the final output increases substantially as many reasoning branches would be trapped in the over-thinking dilemma, producing excessively long responses. Secondly, generating multiple reasoning branches for each request increases memory consumption, which is unsuitable for LLM serving since we can only batch a limited number of requests to process simultaneously. To address this, we present SART, a serving framework for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning. The essential idea is to manage the thinking to be short and right, rather than long. For one thing, we devise a redundant sampling with early stopping approach based on empirical observations and theoretic analysis, which increases the likelihood of obtaining short-thinking responses when sampling reasoning branches. For another, we propose to dynamically prune low-quality branches so that only right-thinking branches are maintained, reducing the memory consumption and allowing us to batch more requests. Experimental results demonstrate that SART not only improves the accuracy of LLM reasoning but also enhances the serving efficiency, outperforming existing methods by up to 28.2 times and on average 15.7 times in terms of efficiency when achieving the same level of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUARD: Generation-time LLM Unlearning via Adaptive Restriction and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13312v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching, effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content. Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.</p></details> |  |

However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework that prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Microsoft Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compared to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and explores a fresh UI design principle for application providers to turn applications into agents in the era of LLMs, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |

| **[VersaTune: An Efficient Data Composition Framework for Training Multi-Capability LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11266v5)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As demonstrated by the proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and Claude series, LLMs have the potential to achieve remarkable proficiency across a wide range of domains, including law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc., all within a single model. These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce **VersaTune**, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-domain capabilities during training. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the subsequent training process, domain weights are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results indicate that VersaTune is effective in multi-domain fostering, with an improvement of 35.21\% in the overall multi-ability performances compared to uniform domain weights. Furthermore, we find that Qwen-2.5-32B + VersaTune even surpasses frontier models, including GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3 by 0.86\%, 4.76\% and 4.60\%. Additionally, in scenarios where flexible expansion of a specific domain is required, VersaTune reduces the performance degradation in other domains by 38.77\%, while preserving the training efficacy of the target domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Testing in LLMs: Insights into Decision-Making Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13195v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world decision-making systems, understanding their behavioural vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While existing evaluation metrics focus primarily on reasoning accuracy or factual correctness, they often overlook whether LLMs are robust to adversarial manipulation or capable of using adaptive strategy in dynamic environments. This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task. These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3, revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in strategy adaptation. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns across models and emphasize the importance of adaptability and fairness recognition for trustworthy AI deployment. Rather than offering a performance benchmark, this work proposes a methodology for diagnosing decision-making weaknesses in LLM-based agents, providing actionable insights for alignment and safety research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13175v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight: the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures. This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment. SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Case Study of Cross-Lingual Zero-Shot Generalization for Classical Languages in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13173v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (\acco), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, \acco~reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is This Collection Worth My LLM's Time? Automatically Measuring Information Potential in Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13691v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) converge towards similar capabilities, the key to advancing their performance lies in identifying and incorporating valuable new information sources. However, evaluating which text collections are worth the substantial investment required for digitization, preprocessing, and integration into LLM systems remains a significant challenge. We present a novel approach to this challenge: an automated pipeline that evaluates the potential information gain from text collections without requiring model training or fine-tuning. Our method generates multiple choice questions (MCQs) from texts and measures an LLM's performance both with and without access to the source material. The performance gap between these conditions serves as a proxy for the collection's information potential. We validate our approach using five strategically selected datasets: EPFL PhD manuscripts, a private collection of Venetian historical records, two sets of Wikipedia articles on related topics, and a synthetic baseline dataset. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies collections containing valuable novel information, providing a practical tool for prioritizing data acquisition and integration efforts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Level Explainability for Auditing & Steering LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07610v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Submission to Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Single-Task: Robust Multi-Task Length Generalization for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11525v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Length generalization, the ability to solve problems longer than those seen during training, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). Previous work modifies positional encodings (PEs) and data formats to improve length generalization on specific symbolic tasks such as addition and sorting. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited to special tasks, often degrading general language performance. Furthermore, they are typically evaluated on small transformers trained from scratch on single tasks and can cause performance drop when applied during post-training stage of practical LLMs with general capabilities. Hu et al., (2024) proposed Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) to improve length generalization in the post-training stage of LLMs. Despite its compatibility with practical models and strong performance, RFFT is proposed for single tasks too, requiring re-training for each individual task with extensive examples. In this paper, we study length generalization in multi-task settings and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), the first framework enabling robust cross-task length generalization. As our first contribution, we construct a large length generalization dataset containing 86 tasks spanning code execution, number processing, symbolic and logical reasoning tasks, beyond the common addition or multiplication tasks. Secondly, we show that cross-task length generalization is possible with Meta-RFFT. After training on a large number of tasks and instances, the models achieve remarkable length generalization ability on unseen tasks with minimal fine-tuning or one-shot prompting. For example, after fine-tuning on 1 to 5 digit addition, our 32B model achieves 95% accuracy on 30 digit addition, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1-671B: 72%), despite never seeing this task during RF-pretraining.</p></details> |  |

However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.</p></details> |  |

Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs. Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer ...</summary><p>Peer reviewed publication at ESWC 2025 Resources Track</p></details> |

Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-wise Adaptive Integration of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Task-Specific LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13026v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse languages.

However, the security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents, encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g., Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile agents and identifying security threats across three core capability dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice, we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios. Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases, agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile automation.</p></details> |  |

Most contemporary reasoning approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However, the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO, including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of 96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance. Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs' performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhyang2226/AR-Lopti.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |

Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at https://github.com/MobiSense/SpecOffload .</p></details> |  |

As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning.

However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning BO: Enhancing Bayesian Optimization with Long-Context Reasoning Power of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12833v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO) provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses, Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%, whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts. This enhanced reasoning capability paves the way for more efficient automated scientific experimentation while maintaining computational feasibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Prompting Enhances Sentence Embeddings in LLMs through Inference-Time Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12831v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12814v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAVIT: Efficient and Accurate Human Value Identification from Text data via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12792v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector - a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs, enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other LLM-based strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[KunServe: Parameter-centric Memory Management for Efficient Memory Throttling Handling in LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18169v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued. This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToTRL: Unlock LLM Tree-of-Thoughts Reasoning Potential through Puzzles Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12717v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection. The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM-based QE suffers from a fundamental limitation: it often fails to generate relevant knowledge, degrading search performance. Prior studies have focused on hallucination, yet its underlying cause--LLM knowledge deficiencies--remains underexplored. This paper systematically examines two failure cases in LLM-based QE: (1) when the LLM lacks query knowledge, leading to incorrect expansions, and (2) when the query is ambiguous, causing biased refinements that narrow search coverage. We conduct controlled experiments across multiple datasets, evaluating the effects of knowledge and query ambiguity on retrieval performance using sparse and dense retrieval models. Our results reveal that LLM-based QE can significantly degrade the retrieval effectiveness when knowledge in the LLM is insufficient or query ambiguity is high. We introduce a framework for evaluating QE under these conditions, providing insights into the limitations of LLM-based retrieval augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 short paper track</p></details> |

This paper investigates whether such persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware safety evaluation and alignment strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Grained Patch Training for Efficient LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15087v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for recommendation by converting interacted item history into language modeling. However, constrained by the limited context length of LLMs, existing approaches have to truncate item history in the prompt, focusing only on recent interactions and sacrificing the ability to model long-term history. To enable LLMs to model long histories, we pursue a concise embedding representation for items and sessions. In the LLM embedding space, we construct an item's embedding by aggregating its textual token embeddings; similarly, we construct a session's embedding by aggregating its item embeddings. While efficient, this way poses two challenges since it ignores the temporal significance of user interactions and LLMs do not natively interpret our custom embeddings. To overcome these, we propose PatchRec, a multi-grained patch training method consisting of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with aggregated embeddings -- patches, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which enables LLMs to capture time-aware significance in interaction history. Extensive experiments show that PatchRec effectively models longer behavior histories with improved efficiency. This work facilitates the practical use of LLMs for modeling long behavior histories.

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into scientific research, understanding how researchers adapt to it reveals timely opportunities for CSCW research -- particularly in supporting new forms of collaboration, knowledge practices, and infrastructure in AI-driven science. This study quantifies LLM impacts on scientific knowledge production based on an evaluation workflow that combines an insider-outsider perspective with a knowledge production framework. Our findings reveal how LLMs catalyze both innovation and reorganization in scientific communities, offering insights into the broader transformation of knowledge production in the age of generative AI and sheds light on new research opportunities in CSCW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Minds Better Than One: Collaborative Reward Modeling for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10597v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, noisy preferences in human feedback can lead to reward misgeneralization - a phenomenon where reward models learn spurious correlations or overfit to noisy preferences, which poses important challenges to the generalization of RMs. This paper systematically analyzes the characteristics of preference pairs and aims to identify how noisy preferences differ from human-aligned preferences in reward modeling. Our analysis reveals that noisy preferences are difficult for RMs to fit, as they cause sharp training fluctuations and irregular gradient updates. These distinctive dynamics suggest the feasibility of identifying and excluding such noisy preferences. Empirical studies demonstrate that policy LLM optimized with a reward model trained on the full preference dataset, which includes substantial noise, performs worse than the one trained on a subset of exclusively high quality preferences. To address this challenge, we propose an online Collaborative Reward Modeling (CRM) framework to achieve robust preference learning through peer review and curriculum learning. In particular, CRM maintains two RMs that collaboratively filter potential noisy preferences by peer-reviewing each other's data selections. Curriculum learning synchronizes the capabilities of two models, mitigating excessive disparities to promote the utility of peer review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRM significantly enhances RM generalization, with up to 9.94 points improvement on RewardBench under an extreme 40\% noise. Moreover, CRM can seamlessly extend to implicit-reward alignment methods, offering a robust and versatile alignment strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Act: Multi-Step Planning and Reasoning Improves Acting in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09970v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge lies in automatically identifying valuable subsets from large datasets to boost both the effectiveness and efficiency of instruction tuning. In this paper, we first establish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data value: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method comprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring step, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and introduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample difficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation diversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability assessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset objective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the most valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds, incorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively. Experiments on both public datasets and the real-world Taobao Live application demonstrate the effectiveness of D3 in endowing LLMs with competitive or even superior instruction-following capabilities using less than 10\% of the entire dataset.</p></details> | IJCAI'25 |

Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out of the box.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages (9 pages of content, 4 pages of references, 9 pages of supplementary material), 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Peer Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15772v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrity of peer review is fundamental to scientific progress, but the rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced concerns that some reviewers may rely on these tools to generate reviews rather than writing them independently. Although some venues have banned LLM-assisted reviewing, enforcement remains difficult as existing detection tools cannot reliably distinguish between fully generated reviews and those merely polished with AI assistance. In this work, we address the challenge of detecting LLM-generated reviews. We consider the approach of performing indirect prompt injection via the paper's PDF, prompting the LLM to embed a covert watermark in the generated review, and subsequently testing for presence of the watermark in the review. We identify and address several pitfalls in na\"ive implementations of this approach. Our primary contribution is a rigorous watermarking and detection framework that offers strong statistical guarantees. Specifically, we introduce watermarking schemes and hypothesis tests that control the family-wise error rate across multiple reviews, achieving higher statistical power than standard corrections such as Bonferroni, while making no assumptions about the nature of human-written reviews. We explore multiple indirect prompt injection strategies--including font-based embedding and obfuscated prompts--and evaluate their effectiveness under various reviewer defense scenarios. Our experiments find high success rates in watermark embedding across various LLMs. We also empirically find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice. In contrast, we find that Bonferroni-style corrections are too conservative to be useful in this setting.</p></details> | 27 pages, 2 figures |

While recent methods rely on complex learned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and evaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work, we revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a well-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often outperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks spanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as well as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs. Our findings reveal that the locality properties of model performance in embedding space enable simple non-parametric methods to achieve strong routing decisions with lower sample complexity than parametric approaches. This challenges the prevailing trend toward sophisticated architectures and highlights the importance of thoroughly evaluating simple baselines before investing in complex solutions. To support reproducibility and further exploration, we will release all benchmarks and code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the focus of XAI is being extended toward explaining Large Language Models (LLMs). This extension calls for a significant transformation in the XAI methodologies for two reasons. First, many existing XAI methods cannot be directly applied to LLMs due to their complexity and advanced capabilities. Second, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, the role of XAI shifts from merely opening the ``black box'' to actively enhancing the productivity and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings. Meanwhile, the conversation and generation abilities of LLMs can reciprocally enhance XAI. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Usable XAI in the context of LLMs by analyzing (1) how XAI can explain and improve LLM-based AI systems and (2) how XAI techniques can be improved by using LLMs. We introduce 10 strategies, introducing the key techniques for each and discussing their associated challenges. We also provide case studies to demonstrate how to obtain and leverage explanations.

Meanwhile, it has been shown that LLM performance can be improved through self-consistency: prompting the LLM to do the same task multiple times (possibly in perturbed ways) and then aggregating the responses. To take advantage of self-consistency, we hypothesize that batched PW strategies, where multiple passages are judged in one LLM call, are better suited than one-by-one PW methods since a larger input context can induce more diverse LLM sampling across self-consistency calls. We first propose several candidate batching strategies to create prompt diversity across self-consistency calls through subset reselection and permutation. We then test our batched PW methods on relevance assessment and ranking tasks against one-by-one PW and listwise LLM ranking baselines with and without self-consistency, using three passage retrieval datasets and GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3, and Amazon Nova Pro. We find that batched PW methods outperform all baselines, and show that batching can greatly amplify the positive effects of self-consistency. For instance, on our legal search dataset, GPT-4o one-by-one PW ranking NDCG@10 improves only from 44.9% to 46.8% without self-consistency vs. with 15 self consistency calls, while batched PW ranking improves from 43.8% to 51.3%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems, particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts, categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable language systems.</p></details> | Preprint |

We present Adaptive LLM Agent System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i) absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia, and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

This limitation necessitates scaling up computational responses through self-generated data, yet current methods struggle due to spurious correlated data caused by ineffective exploration across all reasoning stages. To address such challenge, we introduce \textbf{MARGE}: Improving \textbf{Ma}th \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}xploration, a novel method to address this issue and enhance mathematical reasoning through hit-guided exploration. MARGE systematically explores intermediate reasoning states derived from self-generated solutions, enabling adequate exploration and improved credit assignment throughout the reasoning process. Through extensive experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks, we demonstrate that MARGE significantly improves reasoning capabilities without requiring external annotations or training additional value models. Notably, MARGE improves both single-shot accuracy and exploration diversity, mitigating a common trade-off in alignment methods. These results demonstrate MARGE's effectiveness in enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and unlocking the potential of scaling self-generated training data.

This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities, they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality -- enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.</p></details> |  |

We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.</p></details> | <details><summary>We co...</summary><p>We commit to fully open-source our patent dataset</p></details> |
| **[IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12442v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic. This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed **L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands, and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents, offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based environments.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.</p></details> |  |

These approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as labeled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (\ours), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled questions in a latent semantic space, \ours achieves competitive performance compared to supervised counterparts on both mathematical and free-form natural reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, \ours boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves the accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Base from 32.1\% to 50.1\% on MMLU-Pro.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that -- contrary to prior claims -- truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing LLM responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd", can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds. In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs (accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic and gender-related contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm, which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage. Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview.

Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Systems must extract all problem conditions, decompose a chain of thought into statement-evidence pairs, and verify the logical validity of each pair. Leveraging only the off-the-shelf Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we craft a concise few-shot, multi-turn prompt that first enumerates all conditions and then guides the model to label, cite, and adjudicate every reasoning step. A lightweight post-processor based on regular expressions normalises spans and enforces the official JSON schema. Without fine-tuning, external retrieval, or ensembling, our method ranks 5th overall, achieving macro F1 scores on par with substantially more complex and resource-consuming pipelines. We conclude by analysing the strengths and limitations of our approach and outlining directions for future research in structural reasoning with LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/LLMSR-asdfo123.</p></details> |  |

Unveiling the Capabilities of LLMs in Detecting Offensive Language with Annotation Disagreement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06207v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for offensive language detection, yet their ability to handle annotation disagreement remains underexplored. Disagreement samples, which arise from subjective interpretations, pose a unique challenge due to their ambiguous nature. Understanding how LLMs process these cases, particularly their confidence levels, can offer insight into their alignment with human annotators. This study systematically evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs in detecting offensive language at varying levels of annotation agreement. We analyze binary classification accuracy, examine the relationship between model confidence and human disagreement, and explore how disagreement samples influence model decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with low-agreement samples, often exhibiting overconfidence in these ambiguous cases. However, utilizing disagreement samples in training improves both detection accuracy and model alignment with human judgment. These insights provide a foundation for enhancing LLM-based offensive language detection in real-world moderation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted at the ACL 2025</p></details> |

Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations, overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods, with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have demonstrated outstanding performance in understanding and generating contexts for different scenarios, they are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, which are mostly via text input. In this paper, we introduce the first voice-based jailbreak attack against multimodal LLMs, termed as Flanking Attack, which can process different types of input simultaneously towards the multimodal LLMs. Our work is motivated by recent advancements in monolingual voice-driven large language models, which have introduced new attack surfaces beyond traditional text-based vulnerabilities for LLMs. To investigate these risks, we examine the state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, which can be accessed via different types of inputs such as audio input, focusing on how adversarial prompts can bypass its defense mechanisms. We propose a novel strategy, in which the disallowed prompt is flanked by benign, narrative-driven prompts. It is integrated in the Flanking Attack which attempts to humanizes the interaction context and execute the attack through a fictional setting. Further, to better evaluate the attack performance, we present a semi-automated self-assessment framework for policy violation detection. We demonstrate that Flanking Attack is capable of manipulating state-of-the-art LLMs into generating misaligned and forbidden outputs, which achieves an average attack success rate ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 across seven forbidden scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This issue is further exacerbated in languages with multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along with improvements across other evaluation settings.

It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95% full-sized performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval, an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively. By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable, automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26 leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Context Conditioning and PWP Prompting for Multimodal Validation of Chemical Formulas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12257v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs) whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available, general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single, complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably, this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Existing efforts to study sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extraction. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end, we evaluate various open LLMs - including BioMistral and Llama-2 models - on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain of-Thought (CoT) and Self Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We propose a general method to transform existing LLM evaluations into a series of progressively more difficult tasks. These enhanced evaluations emphasize reasoning capabilities and can reveal relative performance differences that are not apparent in the original assessments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new multiple-choice test corpus, extend it into a family of evaluations, and assess a collection of LLMs. Our results offer insights into the comparative abilities of these models, particularly highlighting the differences between base LLMs and more recent "reasoning" models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05831v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.</p></details> |  |

However, current reward models, which typically operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs. In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to achieve additional performance gains.</p></details> |  |

As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main, 18 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While these models serve as a promising alternative to human annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages, with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages. Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual judge in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-DSE: Searching Accelerator Parameters with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12188v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of programming domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) by raising the abstraction level, optimizing hardware directive parameters remains a significant hurdle. Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency.We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[RAS: Retrieval-And-Structuring for Knowledge-Intensive LLM Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10996v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, yet they often struggle with multi-step reasoning due to the unstructured nature of retrieved context. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods provide external information, the lack of explicit organization among retrieved passages limits their effectiveness, leading to brittle reasoning pathways. Recent interpretability studies highlighting the importance of structured intermediate reasoning further align with this perspective. We propose Retrieval-And-Structuring (RAS), a framework that dynamically constructs query-specific knowledge graphs through iterative retrieval and structured knowledge building. RAS interleaves targeted retrieval planning with incremental graph construction, enabling models to assemble and reason over evolving knowledge structures tailored to each query. On seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks, RAS consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 6.4% and 7.0% gains with open-source and proprietary LLMs, respectively. Our results demonstrate that dynamic, query-specific knowledge structuring offers a robust path to improving reasoning accuracy and robustness in language model generation.

In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |

We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$ task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$, $\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore, we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available ($\href{https://github.com/choukrani/llm-babybench}{\text{GitHub}}$, $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/salem-mbzuai/LLM-BabyBench}{\text{HuggingFace}}$).</p></details> |  |

Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, Preprint in review</p></details> |

Despite advances in detection systems and widespread employee training, attackers continue to innovate, posing ongoing threats. Two emerging vectors stand out in the current landscape: QR-code baits and LLM-enabled pretexting. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of current defenses against these attacks, particularly when it comes to real-world impact on employees. This gap leaves uncertainty around to what extent related countermeasures are justified or needed. Our work addresses this issue. We conduct three phishing simulations across organizations of varying sizes -- from small-medium businesses to a multinational enterprise. In total, we send over 71k emails targeting employees, including: a "traditional" phishing email with a click-through button; a nearly-identical "quishing" email with a QR code instead; and a phishing email written with the assistance of an LLM and open-source intelligence. Our results show that quishing emails have the same effectiveness as traditional phishing emails at luring users to the landing webpage -- which is worrying, given that quishing emails are much harder to identify even by operational detectors. We also find that LLMs can be very good "social engineers": in one company, over 30% of the emails opened led to visiting the landing webpage -- a rate exceeding some prior benchmarks. Finally, we complement our study by conducting a survey across the organizations' employees, measuring their "perceived" phishing awareness. Our findings suggest a correlation between higher self-reported awareness and organizational resilience to phishing attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AsiaCCS'25</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e., predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence. The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically, using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27 percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness, equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Iterative Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general performance, enabling smaller models to achieve capabilities comparable to their larger counterparts remains a critical challenge. For humans, iterative refinement of problem analysis and responses is a common strategy to enhance answer quality. However, we observe that existing LLMs exhibit limited ability to refine their outputs for quality improvement. In this paper, we first investigate mechanisms to unlock and progressively enhance self-refinement ability in smaller models within an iterative preference optimization framework, aiming to bridge the performance gap with larger models. To this end, we propose EVOLVE, a novel post-training and inference framework that iteratively integrates preference training with self-refinement-driven data collection. During training, EVOLVE strengthens the model's direct question-answering ability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. At inference, the framework leverages this capability to generate progressively refined responses, which are filtered to construct datasets for subsequent rounds of preference training. Experiments demonstrate EVOLVE's exceptional performance: when applied to Llama-3.1-8B base model and under the self-refinement setting, it surpasses state-of-the-art models including Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT-4o, achieving a 62.3% length-controlled win rate and 63.3% raw win rate on AlpacaEval 2, along with a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard. Furthermore, EVOLVE consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose FORMED, a novel framework for repurposing a backbone foundation model, pre-trained on generic time series, to enable highly generalizable MedTS classification on unseen datasets. FORMED combines the backbone with a novel classifier comprising two components: (1) task-specific channel embeddings and label queries, dynamically sized to match any number of channels and target classes, and (2) a shared decoding attention layer, jointly trained across datasets to capture medical domain knowledge through task-agnostic feature-query interactions. After repurposing, FORMED achieves seamless adaptation to unseen MedTS datasets through lightweight label query training (0.1% of parameters), eliminating the need for full fine-tuning or architectural redesign. We evaluate FORMED on 5 diverse MedTS datasets, benchmarking against 11 Task-Specific Models (TSM) and 4 Task-Specific Adaptation (TSA) methods. Our results demonstrate FORMED's dominant performance, achieving up to 35% absolute improvement in F1-score (on ADFTD dataset) over specialized baselines. Further analysis reveals consistent generalization across varying channel configurations, time series lengths, and clinical tasks, which are key challenges in real-world deployment. By decoupling domain-invariant representation learning from task-specific adaptation, FORMED establishes a scalable and resource-efficient paradigm for foundation model repurposing in healthcare. This approach prioritizes clinical adaptability over rigid task-centric design, offering a practical pathway for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits.

Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$. We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores.

Existing studies analyze sentiment based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features, enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13085v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and $\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations. Audio samples are shared in $\href{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

| **[Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Low-Latency Event Stream-based Visual Object Tracking: A Slow-Fast Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12903v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years, offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework first performs graph-based representation learning from high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones, yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world scenarios. The source code has been released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SlowFast_Event_Track.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Inspired Robustness for Nonlinear Models via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12868v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributional robustness is a central goal of prediction algorithms due to the prevalent distribution shifts in real-world data. The prediction model aims to minimize the worst-case risk among a class of distributions, a.k.a., an uncertainty set. Causality provides a modeling framework with a rigorous robustness guarantee in the above sense, where the uncertainty set is data-driven rather than pre-specified as in traditional distributional robustness optimization. However, current causality-inspired robustness methods possess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where the causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear. In this work, we propose a nonlinear method under a causal framework by incorporating recent developments in identifiable representation learning and establish a distributional robustness guarantee. To our best knowledge, this is the first causality-inspired robustness method with such a finite-radius robustness guarantee in nonlinear settings. Empirical validation of the theoretical findings is conducted on both synthetic data and real-world single-cell data, also illustrating that finite-radius robustness is crucial.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Enhanced Representation Learning for Single-Cell Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09427v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity. Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Mechanisms of Adversarial Data Augmentation for Robust and Adaptive Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12681v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training, improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home -- demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for cross-domain transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Forest Autoencoders for Guided Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13257v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research has produced robust methods for unsupervised data visualization. Yet supervised visualization$\unicode{x2013}$where expert labels guide representations$\unicode{x2013}$remains underexplored, as most supervised approaches prioritize classification over visualization. Recently, RF-PHATE, a diffusion-based manifold learning method leveraging random forests and information geometry, marked significant progress in supervised visualization. However, its lack of an explicit mapping function limits scalability and its application to unseen data, posing challenges for large datasets and label-scarce scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Random Forest Autoencoders (RF-AE), a neural network-based framework for out-of-sample kernel extension that combines the flexibility of autoencoders with the supervised learning strengths of random forests and the geometry captured by RF-PHATE. RF-AE enables efficient out-of-sample supervised visualization and outperforms existing methods, including RF-PHATE's standard kernel extension, in both accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, RF-AE is robust to the choice of hyperparameters and generalizes to any kernel-based dimensionality reduction method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Invariant Risk Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12506v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments. In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel ``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and generalizing across environments without access to labels.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the learned representations from multi-modal contrastive learning beyond linear representations and specific data distributions. Our analysis reveals that, enabled by temperature optimization, multi-modal contrastive learning not only maximizes mutual information between modalities but also adapts to intrinsic dimensions of data, which can be much lower than user-specified dimensions for representation vectors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of contrastive learning to learn low-dimensional and informative representations, bridging theoretical insights and practical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperbolic Residual Quantization: Discrete Representations for Data with Latent Hierarchies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12404v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching, necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture latent hierarchies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Thermodynamics I: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</p></details> |  |

Many recent approaches enhance retinal image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs, associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data, indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal disease analysis.

Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

| **[Structured Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12143v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.</p></details> |  |

While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated figure layout, added project page link</p></details> |

Yet, efforts in robotics have struggled to achieve similar success, limited by either the need for costly robotic annotations or the lack of representations that effectively model the physical world. In this paper, we introduce ARM4R, an Auto-regressive Robotic Model that leverages low-level 4D Representations learned from human video data to yield a better pre-trained robotic model. Specifically, we focus on utilizing 3D point tracking representations from videos derived by lifting 2D representations into 3D space via monocular depth estimation across time. These 4D representations maintain a shared geometric structure between the points and robot state representations up to a linear transformation, enabling efficient transfer learning from human video data to low-level robotic control. Our experiments show that ARM4R can transfer efficiently from human video data to robotics and consistently improves performance on tasks across various robot environments and configurations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first reveal that the information conflicts in current visual MBRL algorithms stem from visual representation learning and latent dynamics modeling with an information-theoretic perspective. Based on this finding, we present a new algorithm to resolve information conflicts for visual MBRL, named MInCo, which mitigates information conflicts by leveraging negative-free contrastive learning, aiding in learning invariant representation and robust policies despite noisy observations. To prevent the dominance of visual representation learning, we introduce time-varying reweighting to bias the learning towards dynamics modeling as training proceeds. We evaluate our method on several robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions. Our experiments demonstrate that MInCo learns invariant representations against background noise and consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art visual MBRL methods.

| **[No Other Representation Component Is Needed: Diffusion Transformers Can Provide Representation Guidance by Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02831v4)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance the generation quality of diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an external and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtains representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer with higher noise to that in the later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that are heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Self-...</summary><p>Self-Representation Alignment for Diffusion Transformers.

| **[On the Value of Cross-Modal Misalignment in Multimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10143v4)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit cross-modal misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize cross-modal misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: Selection bias, where some semantic variables are absent in the text, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are altered -- both leading to misalignment in data pairs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings via extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of cross-modal misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p></details> |  |

The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact. Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since, until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks (predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Order Wavelet Derivative Transform for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11781v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Residual Feature Integration is Sufficient to Prevent Negative Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11771v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning toolbox.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

| **[Zero-Shot Visual Generalization in Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11719v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

| **[Invariant Representations via Wasserstein Correlation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11702v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the use of Wasserstein correlation -- a normalized measure of statistical dependence based on the Wasserstein distance between a joint distribution and the product of its marginals -- for unsupervised representation learning. Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which naturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded distributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while approximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input distribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation maximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from scratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is approximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of augmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties of the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion of an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When the maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed to the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the desired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which show that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or can, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under this training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results for optimal transport-based dependence measures.

| **[Urban Representation Learning for Fine-grained Economic Mapping: A Semi-supervised Graph-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11645v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities, seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model. Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise economic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Society Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). 70 pages, 10 Figures, 15 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Nerve Fiber Distribution Patterns in 3D-PLI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17207v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A comprehensive understanding of the organizational principles in the human brain requires, among other factors, well-quantifiable descriptors of nerve fiber architecture. Three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) is a microscopic imaging technique that enables insights into the fine-grained organization of myelinated nerve fibers with high resolution. Descriptors characterizing the fiber architecture observed in 3D-PLI would enable downstream analysis tasks such as multimodal correlation studies, clustering, and mapping. However, best practices for observer-independent characterization of fiber architecture in 3D-PLI are not yet available. To this end, we propose the application of a fully data-driven approach to characterize nerve fiber architecture in 3D-PLI images using self-supervised representation learning. We introduce a 3D-Context Contrastive Learning (CL-3D) objective that utilizes the spatial neighborhood of texture examples across histological brain sections of a 3D reconstructed volume to sample positive pairs for contrastive learning. We combine this sampling strategy with specifically designed image augmentations to gain robustness to typical variations in 3D-PLI parameter maps. The approach is demonstrated for the 3D reconstructed occipital lobe of a vervet monkey brain. We show that extracted features are highly sensitive to different configurations of nerve fibers, yet robust to variations between consecutive brain sections arising from histological processing. We demonstrate their practical applicability for retrieving clusters of homogeneous fiber architecture, performing classification with minimal annotations, and query-based retrieval of characteristic components of fiber architecture such as U-fibers.</p></details> | Journal version |
| **[Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning: The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11581v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.</p></details> | 43 pages, 25 figures |

We introduce a family of premetrics that capture different degrees of structural similarity between graphs and relate these similarities to generalization, and consequently, the performance of expressive GNNs. By considering a setting where graph labels are correlated with structural features, we derive generalization bounds that depend on the distance between training and test graphs, model complexity, and training set size. These bounds reveal that more expressive GNNs may generalize worse unless their increased complexity is balanced by a sufficiently large training set or reduced distance between training and test graphs. Our findings relate expressivity and generalization, offering theoretical insights supported by empirical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While the recent asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines, existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations. Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deviating from the prevailing paradigms of subword tokenizations and "one model to rule them all", AnnualBERT adopts whole words as tokens and is composed of a base RoBERTa model pretrained from scratch on the full-text of 1.7 million arXiv papers published until 2008 and a collection of progressively trained models on arXiv papers at an annual basis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AnnualBERT models by showing that they not only have comparable performances in standard tasks but also achieve state-of-the-art performances on domain-specific NLP tasks as well as link prediction tasks in the arXiv citation network. We then utilize probing tasks to quantify the models' behavior in terms of representation learning and forgetting as time progresses. Our approach enables the pretrained models to not only improve performances on scientific text processing tasks but also to provide insights into the development of scientific discourse over time.

However, constrained by complex fact representation forms, existing link prediction models for beyond-triple facts have difficulty achieving hierarchical fact modeling and generalizing the modules for one specific facts to other fact types. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework (UniHR) for unified knowledge graph link prediction. It consists of a unified Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module as graph encoder. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing the semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations.

This paper presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of gradient-based attacks in CFL environments and evaluates random client selection as a defensive strategy. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that random client selection proves particularly effective in defending against gradient attacks in the CFL network. Our findings provide valuable insights for implementing robust security measures in contrastive federated learning systems, contributing to the development of more secure collaborative learning frameworks</p></details> |  |

Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms.

However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | 18 pages,3 figuares |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores between conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Furthermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMRL++: Parameter-Efficient and Interaction-Aware Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10088v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable, modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference, a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between task-specific adaptation and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract appearing here is slightly shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 20.5 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</p></details> |  |

While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.

Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classification in multiclass settings. Digital twins of 5G networks increasingly employ graph classification as the main method for identifying failure types. However, the skewed distribution of failure occurrences is a significant class-imbalance problem that prevents practical graph data mining. Previous studies have not sufficiently addressed this complex problem. This paper, proposes class-Fourier GNN (CF-GNN) that introduces a class-oriented spectral filtering mechanism to ensure precise classification by estimating a unique spectral filter for each class. This work employs eigenvalue and eigenvector spectral filtering to capture and adapt to variations in minority classes, ensuring accurate class-specific feature discrimination, and adept at graph representation learning for complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CF-GNN could help create new techniques for enhancing classifiers and investigate the characteristics of the multiclass imbalanced data in a network digital twin system.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.06595</p></details> |

In this study, we present a novel approach utilizing radiogenomic data including structural MRI images and gene expression data, for Alzheimer's disease detection. Our framework introduces a novel heterogeneous bipartite graph representation learning featuring two distinct node types: genes and images. The network can effectively classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) into three distinct stages:AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitive Normal (CN) classes, utilizing a small dataset. Additionally, it identified which genes play a significant role in each of these classification groups. We evaluate the performance of our approach using metrics including classification accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The proposed technique holds potential for extending to radiogenomic-based classification to other diseases.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MDL-Pool: Adaptive Multilevel Graph Pooling Based on Minimum Description Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10263v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph pooling compresses graphs and summarises their topological properties and features in a vectorial representation. It is an essential part of deep graph representation learning and is indispensable in graph-level tasks like classification or regression. Current approaches pool hierarchical structures in graphs by iteratively applying shallow pooling operators up to a fixed depth. However, they disregard the interdependencies between structures at different hierarchical levels and do not adapt to datasets that contain graphs with different sizes that may require pooling with various depths. To address these issues, we propose MDL-Pool, a pooling operator based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, whose loss formulation explicitly models the interdependencies between different hierarchical levels and facilitates a direct comparison between multiple pooling alternatives with different depths. MDP-Pool builds on the map equation, an information-theoretic objective function for community detection, which naturally implements Occam's razor and balances between model complexity and goodness-of-fit via the MDL. We demonstrate MDL-Pool's competitive performance in an empirical evaluation against various baselines across standard graph classification datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TARGET: Benchmarking Table Retrieval for Generative Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11545v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components, in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Our architecture integrates pseudo-labels derived from generated textual prompts to guide implicit alignment of emotional semantics. To capture shared information across multi-views, we propose a joint embedding space that aligns multiview representations without requiring explicit supervision. We further enhance the discriminability of our model through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[OLinear: A Linear Model for Time Series Forecasting in Orthogonally Transformed Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08550v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an $\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series' temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer, $\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based forecasters.

Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGSSM: Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09017v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the dynamic graph representation learning methods involve dividing a dynamic graph into discrete snapshots to capture the evolving behavior of nodes over time. Existing methods primarily capture only local or global structures of each node within a snapshot using message-passing and random walk-based methods. Then, they utilize sequence-based models (e.g., transformers) to encode the temporal evolution of node embeddings, and meta-learning techniques to update the model parameters. However, these approaches have two limitations. First, they neglect the extraction of global and local information simultaneously in each snapshot. Second, they fail to consider the model's performance in the current snapshot during parameter updates, resulting in a lack of temporal dependency management. Recently, HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) algorithm has gained attention for their ability to optimize and preserve sequence history in State Space Model (SSM). To address the aforementioned limitations in dynamic graph representation learning, we propose a novel method called Multi-view Dynamic Graph Embeddings with State Space Model Gradient Update (DyGSSM). Our approach combines Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) for local feature extraction and random walk with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for global feature extraction in each snapshot. We then integrate the local and global features using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate an SSM based on HiPPO algorithm to account for long-term dependencies when updating model parameters, ensuring that model performance in each snapshot informs subsequent updates. Experiments on five public datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in 17 out of 20 cases.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era.

Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Early and accurate diagnosis of POD is critical and achievable. Here, we propose a POD prediction framework comprising a Transformer representation model followed by traditional machine learning algorithms. Our approaches utilizes multi-modal physiological data, including amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), vital signs, electrocardiographic monitor data as well as hemodynamic parameters. We curated the first multi-modal POD dataset encompassing two patient types and evaluated the various Transformer architectures for representation learning. Empirical results indicate a consistent improvements of sensitivity and Youden index in patient TYPE I using Transformer representations, particularly our fusion adaptation of Pathformer. By enabling effective delirium diagnosis from postoperative day 1 to 3, our extensive experimental findings emphasize the potential of multi-modal physiological data and highlight the necessity of representation learning via multi-modal Transformer architecture in clinical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Vision Transformers with Multi-Scale Causal Intervention for Long-Tailed Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08173v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate long-tail classification by handling the biases introduced by class imbalance. However, along with the change of advanced backbone models from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Visual Transformers (ViT), existing causal models may not achieve an expected performance gain. This paper investigates the influence of existing causal models on CNNs and ViT variants, highlighting that ViT's global feature representation makes it hard for causal methods to model associations between fine-grained features and predictions, which leads to difficulties in classifying tail classes with similar visual appearance. To address these issues, this paper proposes TSCNet, a two-stage causal modeling method to discover fine-grained causal associations through multi-scale causal interventions. Specifically, in the hierarchical causal representation learning stage (HCRL), it decouples the background and objects, applying backdoor interventions at both the patch and feature level to prevent model from using class-irrelevant areas to infer labels which enhances fine-grained causal representation. In the counterfactual logits bias calibration stage (CLBC), it refines the optimization of model's decision boundary by adaptive constructing counterfactual balanced data distribution to remove the spurious associations in the logits caused by data distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on various long-tail benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TSCNet can eliminate multiple biases introduced by data imbalance, which outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we show that bounded GNN architectures correspond to specific fragments of first-order logic (FO), including modal logic (ML), graded modal logic (GML), modal logic with the universal modality (ML(A)), the two-variable fragment (FO2) and its extension with counting quantifiers (C2). To establish these results, we apply methods and tools from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. This provides a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 11 pages |

While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[I Predict Therefore I Am: Is Next Token Prediction Enough to Learn Human-Interpretable Concepts from Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08980v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human-interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result, i.e., the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts given input context, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also provide a unified prospective for understanding of the linear representation hypothesis. Taking this a step further, our finding motivates a reliable evaluation of sparse autoencoders by treating the performance of supervised concept extractors as an upper bound. Pushing this idea even further, it inspires a structural variant that enforces dependence among latent concepts in addition to promoting sparsity. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our structured sparse autoencoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond DAGs: A Latent Partial Causal Model for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06223v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are fundamental graph structures in causal modeling, but identifying the desired DAG from observational data often requires strong assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially for latent causal models and complex multimodal data. This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion.

| **[Stochastic Variational Propagation: Local, Scalable and Efficient Alternative to Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05181v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RealRep: Generalized SDR-to-HDR Conversion with Style Disentangled Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07322v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Dynamic-Range Wide-Color-Gamut (HDR-WCG) technology is becoming increasingly prevalent, intensifying the demand for converting Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content to HDR. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone mapping operators, which are inadequate for handling SDR inputs with diverse styles commonly found in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR method that handles diverse styles in real-world SDR content, termed Realistic Style Disentangled Representation Learning (RealRep). By disentangling luminance and chrominance, we analyze the intrinsic differences between contents with varying styles and propose a disentangled multi-view style representation learning method. This approach captures the guidance prior of true luminance and chrominance distributions across different styles, even when the SDR style distributions exhibit significant variations, thereby establishing a robust embedding space for inverse tone mapping. Motivated by the difficulty of directly utilizing degradation representation priors, we further introduce the Degradation-Domain Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a two-stage framework that performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via degradation-conditioned hierarchical features, enabling robust adaptation across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments show that RealRep consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04055v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Molecular Representation Learning via Structure Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05877v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20127v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and often lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, the Hierarchical Interaction Message Net (HimNet). Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). We systematically evaluate HimNet on eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and three challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria activity, and liver microsomal clearance, covering a broad range of pharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially, one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, the increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs presents a significant challenge for GNN training due to their computational demands, limiting the applicability of GNNs in various scenarios. In response to this challenge, graph condensation (GC) is proposed as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on generating an informative compact graph that enables efficient training of GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to accelerate GNN training, existing GC methods overlook the quality of large training graphs during both the training and inference stages. They indiscriminately emulate the training graph distributions, making the condensed graphs susceptible to noises within the training graph and significantly impeding the application of GC in intricate real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose robust graph condensation (RobGC), a plug-and-play approach for GC to extend the robustness and applicability of condensed graphs in noisy graph structure environments. Specifically, RobGC leverages the condensed graph as a feedback signal to guide the denoising process on the original training graph. A label propagation-based alternating optimization strategy is in place for the condensation and denoising processes, contributing to the mutual purification of the condensed graph and training graph. Additionally, as a GC method designed for inductive graph inference, RobGC facilitates test-time graph denoising by leveraging the noise-free condensed graph to calibrate the structure of the test graph. Extensive experiments show that RobGC is compatible with various GC methods, significantly boosting their robustness under different types and levels of graph structural noises.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TKDE 2025</p></details> |

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We present CheXLearner, the first end-to-end framework that unifies anatomical region detection, Riemannian manifold-based structure alignment, and fine-grained regional semantic guidance. Our proposed Med-Manifold Alignment Module (Med-MAM) leverages hyperbolic geometry to robustly align anatomical structures and capture pathologically meaningful discrepancies across temporal chest X-rays. By introducing regional progression descriptions as supervision, CheXLearner achieves enhanced cross-modal representation learning and supports dynamic low-level feature optimization. Experiments show that CheXLearner achieves 81.12% (+17.2%) average accuracy and 80.32% (+11.05%) F1-score on anatomical region progression detection - substantially outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially in structurally complex regions. Additionally, our model attains a 91.52% average AUC score in downstream disease classification, validating its superior feature representation.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on real-world tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Synthetic images, however, cannot faithfully reproduce real-world scenarios, such as uneven illumination, irregular layout, occlusion, and degradation, resulting in performance disparities when handling complex real-world images. Recent self-supervised learning techniques, notably contrastive learning and masked image modeling (MIM), narrow this domain gap by exploiting unlabeled real text images. This study first analyzes the original Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) and observes that random patch masking predominantly captures low-level textural features but misses high-level contextual representations. To fully exploit the high-level contextual representations, we introduce random blockwise and span masking in the text recognition task. These strategies can mask the continuous image patches and completely remove some characters, forcing the model to infer relationships among characters within a word. Our Multi-Masking Strategy (MMS) integrates random patch, blockwise, and span masking into the MIM frame, which jointly learns low and high-level textual representations. After fine-tuning with real data, MMS outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in various text-related tasks, including text recognition, segmentation, and text-image super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

Existing MIL methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned, which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components, including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g., ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.</p></details> |  |

Unlike natural images, RS imagery presents unique challenges that current MLLMs struggle to handle, particularly in visual grounding and spatial reasoning. This study investigates the limitations of CLIP-based MLLMs in RS, highlighting their failure to differentiate visually distinct yet semantically similar RS images. To address this, we introduce a remote sensing multimodal visual patterns (RSMMVP) benchmark. It is designed to evaluate MLLMs in RS tasks by identifying the CLIP-blind pairs, where CLIP-based models incorrectly assign high similarity scores to visually distinct RS images. Through a visual question answering (VQA) evaluation, we analyze the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing significant limitations in RS specific representation learning. The results provide valuable insights into the weaknesses of CLIP-based visual encoding and offer a foundation for future research to develop more effective MLLMs tailored for remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Eval-...</summary><p>Eval-FoMo2 Workshop in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair, regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM). Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 30 figures.

However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of entities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path selection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path selection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant and noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential modeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving the semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention mechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user interest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as Amazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing recommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10, Recall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop paths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the expressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous recommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical value by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks with recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible paradigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised learning goals differ from downstream tasks, making it tricky to ensure downstream task utility by focusing only on temporal feature characterization. Researchers have proposed multiple transformations to extract discriminative patterns implied in informative time series, trying to fill the gap. Despite the introduction of a variety of feature engineering techniques, e.g. spectral domain, wavelet transformed features, features in image form and symbolic features etc. the utilization of intricate feature fusion methods and dependence on heterogeneous features during inference hampers the scalability of the solutions. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that focuses on aligning and binding time series representations encoded from different modalities, inspired by spectral graph theory, thereby guiding the neural encoder to uncover latent pattern associations among these multi-modal features. In contrast to conventional methods that fuse features from multiple modalities, our proposed approach simplifies the neural architecture by retaining a single time series encoder, consequently leading to preserved scalability. We further demonstrate and prove mechanisms for the encoder to maintain better inductive bias. In our experimental evaluation, we validated the proposed method on a diverse set of time series datasets from various domains. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art URL methods across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g. latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning. Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process, compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases, achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper published in SDM25</p></details> |

This paper introduces directional sign loss (DSL), a novel loss function that approximates the number of mismatches in the signs of finite differences between corresponding elements of two arrays. By penalizing discrepancies in critical points between input and reconstructed data, DSL encourages autoencoders and other learnable compressors to retain the topological features of the original data. We present the mathematical formulation, complexity analysis, and practical implementation of DSL, comparing its behavior to its non-differentiable counterpart and to other topological measures. Experiments on one-, two-, and three-dimensional data show that combining DSL with traditional loss functions preserves topological features more effectively than traditional losses alone. Moreover, DSL serves as a differentiable, efficient proxy for common topology-based metrics, enabling its use in gradient-based optimization frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown to be capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks. In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding. Our contributions include (1) a carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components; (2) a parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters; (3) significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[AdaToken-3D: Dynamic Spatial Gating for Efficient 3D Large Multimodal-Models Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12782v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |
| **[GeoMM: On Geodesic Perspective for Multi-modal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11216v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geodesic distance serves as a reliable means of measuring distance in nonlinear spaces, and such nonlinear manifolds are prevalent in the current multimodal learning. In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Robust Anymodal Segmentor with Unimodal and Cross-modal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17141v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneously using multimodal inputs from multiple sensors to train segmentors is intuitively advantageous but practically challenging. A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Incorporating brain-inspired mechanisms for multimodal learning in artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10176v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Multimodal Prototypes for Visual Recognition with Missing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08283v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enhances deep learning models by enabling them to perceive and understand information from multiple data modalities, such as visual and textual inputs. However, most existing approaches assume the availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[SonicRAG : High Fidelity Sound Effects Synthesis Based on Retrival Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03244v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal learning, with successful applications in text generation and speech synthesis, enabling a deeper understanding and generation of multimodal content. In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond DAGs: A Latent Partial Causal Model for Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06223v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are fundamental graph structures in causal modeling, but identifying the desired DAG from observational data often requires strong assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially for latent causal models and complex multimodal data. This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, it's KDD'2025 under reviewing</p></details> |

We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets. The multimodal large language model (LLM) with the proposed training provides the best results among the investigated methods. We receive near state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UPMC Food-101 dataset. We share the scripts of the proposed method with traditional counterparts at the following repository: github.com/dipuk0506/multimodal</p></details> |  |

Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines. The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The datasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are available at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/NSF-MAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, IJCAI 2025 (International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence) Special Track on AI4Tech: AI Enabling Critical Technologies</p></details> |

We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, and 19 references</p></details> |

In this contribution, we identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 14pages |

Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Model for Focal Liver Lesion Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03350v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of focal liver lesions is crucial for diagnosis and treatment in hepatology. However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Further analysis shows that using a lightweight ResNet18 backbone enhances classification performance, particularly under data-constrained conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures, 4 tables,Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare Proceedings of 13th KES-InMed 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Aggregation of Dependent Expert Distributions in Multimodal Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01134v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Grounding for Efficient Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

| **[A multi-scale vision transformer-based multimodal GeoAI model for mapping Arctic permafrost thaw](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17822v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAP: Isolating Content from Style through Contrastive Learning with Augmented Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16445v6)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have garnered considerable attention for various downstream tasks, mainly due to the remarkable ability of the learned features for generalization. However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations.

| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/airliisc/IndraEye.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR-W PBVS 2025</p></details> |

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |
| **[IoT-AMLHP: Aligned Multimodal Learning of Header-Payload Representations for Resource-Efficient Malicious IoT Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14833v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification is crucial for securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEFT A2Z: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Survey for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14117v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.</p></details> | PEFT Survey paper |

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

| **[A Survey on Cross-Modal Interaction Between Music and Multimodal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12796v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries, particularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MMCLIP: Cross-modal Attention Masked Modelling for Medical Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19546v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Concept Modality Specific Datasets (CMSDs), which consist of data subsets categorized by the modality (visual, textual, or audio) of annotated concepts. Models trained on CMSDs outperform those using traditional legacy training in both early and late fusion approaches. Notably, this approach enables late fusion models to achieve performance close to that of early fusion models. These findings underscore the importance of modality-specific annotations in developing robust, self-explainable video models and contribute to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in complex video analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 Figures |

Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, submitted as a preprint.

Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Efficient Beam Prediction in mmWave Communications with Multimodal Realistic Simulation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05187v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beamforming is a key technology in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications that improves signal transmission by optimizing directionality and intensity. However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> |

While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  |

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces.

Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |

Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion for Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21124v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of pathologic images and genomic data for survival analysis has gained increasing attention with advances in multimodal learning. However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22715v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding human emotions across diverse communication channels. While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

| **[Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18595v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/InfoReg_CVPR2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 16 figures, CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTBench: A Multimodal Time Series Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning and Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16858v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between textual news and time-series evolution is a critical yet under-explored challenge in applied data science. While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data. The dataset provides detailed annotations for seven distinct surficial geologic classes encompassing various geological processes. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline using open-sourced raw data and establish baseline benchmarks using different spatial modalities to demonstrate the utility of EarthScape. As a living dataset with a vision for expansion, EarthScape bridges the gap between computer vision and Earth sciences, offering a valuable resource for advancing research in multimodal learning, geospatial analysis, and geological mapping.

| **[Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning for Bridging Modality Gaps in Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14938v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification (FS-RSSC) presents the challenge of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning (OTAT) framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for advancing multimodal learning in remote sensing applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in FS-RSSC, significantly improving the model performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Welding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16537v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the performance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in skilled production work, with a focus on welding. Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. The source code is to be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IJCAI2025</p></details> |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves.

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid 2025</p></details> |

The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications.

Existing approaches often rely on simple spatiotemporal stacking, which introduces feature redundancy, while subtle joint-level details remain overlooked from a spatial perspective. To this end, we propose a novel HiSTF Mamba framework. The framework is composed of three key modules: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba, and Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). Dual-Spatial Mamba incorporates ``Part-based + Whole-based'' parallel modeling to represent both whole-body coordination and fine-grained joint dynamics. Bi-Temporal Mamba adopts a bidirectional scanning strategy, effectively encoding short-term motion details and long-term dependencies. DSFM further performs redundancy removal and extraction of complementary information for temporal features, then fuses them with spatial features, yielding an expressive spatio-temporal representation. Experimental results on the HumanML3D dataset demonstrate that HiSTF Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. In particular, it reduces the FID score from 0.283 to 0.189, a relative decrease of nearly 30%. These findings validate the effectiveness of HiSTF Mamba in achieving high fidelity and strong semantic alignment in text-to-motion generation.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures, |
| **[Towards Generalization of Tactile Image Generation: Reference-Free Evaluation in a Leakage-Free Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06860v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing, which relies on direct physical contact, is critical for human perception and underpins applications in computer vision, robotics, and multimodal learning. Because tactile data is often scarce and costly to acquire, generating synthetic tactile images provides a scalable solution to augment real-world measurements. However, ensuring robust generalization in synthesizing tactile images-capturing subtle, material-specific contact features-remains challenging. We demonstrate that overlapping training and test samples in commonly used datasets inflate performance metrics, obscuring the true generalizability of tactile models. To address this, we propose a leakage-free evaluation protocol coupled with novel, reference-free metrics-TMMD, I-TMMD, CI-TMMD, and D-TMMD-tailored for tactile generation. Moreover, we propose a vision-to-touch generation method that leverages text as an intermediate modality by incorporating concise, material-specific descriptions during training to better capture essential tactile features. Experiments on two popular visuo-tactile datasets, Touch and Go and HCT, show that our approach achieves superior performance and enhanced generalization in a leakage-free setting.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 10 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |

Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating both textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in this space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as auxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based techniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text as input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning procedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique specially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to improve performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained with this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document image understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined with an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms larger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA also sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging document visual analysis benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks. The implementation code and the pre-trained model will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

| **[BackdoorMBTI: A Backdoor Learning Multimodal Benchmark Tool Kit for Backdoor Defense Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11006v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented significant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert backdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new data binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We also propose a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data, coupled with an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying degrees of data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications\footnote (The source code is available via https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rebalanced Multimodal Learning with Data-aware Unimodal Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03792v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the modality learning degeneration caused by modality imbalance, existing multimodal learning~(MML) approaches primarily attempt to balance the optimization process of each modality from the perspective of model learning. However, almost all existing methods ignore the modality imbalance caused by unimodal data sampling, i.e., equal unimodal data sampling often results in discrepancies in informational content, leading to modality imbalance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel MML approach called \underline{D}ata-aware \underline{U}nimodal \underline{S}ampling~(\method), which aims to dynamically alleviate the modality imbalance caused by sampling. Specifically, we first propose a novel cumulative modality discrepancy to monitor the multimodal learning process. Based on the learning status, we propose a heuristic and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based data-aware unimodal sampling approaches to adaptively determine the quantity of sampled data at each iteration, thus alleviating the modality imbalance from the perspective of sampling. Meanwhile, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into almost all existing multimodal learning approaches as a plugin. Experiments demonstrate that \method~can achieve the best performance by comparing with diverse state-of-the-art~(SOTA) baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization via Self-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05933v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models. Our code will be released after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination therapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.</p></details> |  |

The efficiency of multimodal systems is a critical concern, given the varying costs and resource demands of different modalities. This underscores the necessity for effective modality selection to balance performance gains against resource expenditures. In this study, we propose a novel framework for modality selection that independently learns the representation of each modality. This approach allows for the assessment of each modality's significance within its unique representation space, enabling the development of tailored encoders and facilitating the joint analysis of modalities with distinct characteristics. Our framework aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal learning by optimizing modality integration and selection.</p></details> |  |

Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy. By integrating multimodal learning with contextual embeddings, this work lays the foundation for future advancements in personalized dementia detection and cognitive health research.</p></details> |  |

While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal learning~(MML) has garnered remarkable progress, the existence of modality imbalance hinders multimodal learning from achieving its expected superiority over unimodal models in practice. To overcome this issue, mainstream multimodal learning methods have placed greater emphasis on balancing the learning process. However, these approaches do not explicitly enhance the classification ability of weaker modalities, leading to limited performance promotion. By designing a sustained boosting algorithm, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors using a designed configurable classifier module. Then, we propose an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of weak modality. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art~(SoTA) multimodal learning baselines.</p></details> |  |

Feature disentanglement (FD)-based methods, aiming at learning superior feature representations for multimodal data analysis, have achieved significant success in multimodal learning (MML). Typically, existing FD-based methods separate multimodal data into modality-shared and modality-specific features, and employ concatenation or attention mechanisms to integrate these features. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that these methods could lead to a loss of shared information among subsets of modalities when the inputs contain more than two modalities, and such information is critical for prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods do not adequately interpret the relationships between the decoupled features at the fusion stage. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Complete Feature Disentanglement (CFD) strategy that recovers the lost information during feature decoupling. Specifically, the CFD strategy not only identifies modality-shared and modality-specific features, but also decouples shared features among subsets of multimodal inputs, termed as modality-partial-shared features. We further introduce a new Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Fusion (DMF) module that dynamically integrates these decoupled features, by explicitly learning the local-global relationships among the features. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through classification tasks on three multimodal MRI datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art MML methods with obvious margins, showcasing its superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE JBHI 2025</p></details> |

Many reliable multimodal methods delve into addressing modality-specific or cross-modality noise. However, they fail to handle the coexistence of both types of noise efficiently. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive consideration for noise at both global and individual levels limits their reliability. To address these issues, a reliable multimodal classification method dubbed Multi-Level Inter-Class Confusing Information Removal Network (MICINet) is proposed. MICINet achieves the reliable removal of both types of noise by unifying them into the concept of Inter-class Confusing Information (\textit{ICI}) and eliminating it at both global and individual levels. Specifically, MICINet first reliably learns the global \textit{ICI} distribution through the proposed \textbf{\textit{Global \textbf{ICI} Learning Module}}. Then, it introduces the \textbf{\textit{Global-guided Sample ICI Learning module}} to efficiently remove global-level \textit{ICI} from sample features utilizing the learned global \textit{ICI} distribution. Subsequently, the \textbf{\textit{Sample-adaptive Cross-modality Information Compensation module}} is designed to remove individual-level \textit{ICI} from each sample reliably. This is achieved through interpretable cross-modality information compensation based on the complementary relationship between discriminative features and \textit{ICI} and the perception of the relative quality of modalities introduced by the relative discriminative power. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MICINet outperforms other state-of-the-art reliable multimodal classification methods under various noise conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of scientific video summarization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction: a multimodal learning framework based on belief function theory using structured EHRs and free-text notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04389v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Intensive Care Unit (ICU) outcome prediction is critical for improving patient treatment quality and ICU resource allocation. Existing research mainly focuses on structured data, e.g. demographics and vital signs, and lacks effective frameworks to integrate clinical notes from heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). This study aims to explore a multimodal framework based on belief function theory that can effectively fuse heterogeneous structured EHRs and free-text notes for accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction. The fusion strategy accounts for prediction uncertainty within each modality and conflicts between multimodal data. The experiments on MIMIC-III dataset show that our framework provides more accurate and reliable predictions than existing approaches. Specifically, it outperformed the best baseline by 1.05%/1.02% in BACC, 9.74%/6.04% in F1 score, 1.28%/0.9% in AUROC, and 6.21%/2.68% in AUPRC for predicting mortality and PLOS, respectively. Additionally, it improved the reliability of the predictions with a 26.8%/15.1% reduction in the Brier score and a 25.0%/13.3% reduction in negative log-likelihood. By effectively reducing false positives, the model can aid in better allocation of medical resources in the ICU. Furthermore, the proposed method is very versatile and can be extended to analyzing multimodal EHRs for other clinical tasks. The code implementation is available on https://github.com/yuchengruan/evid_multimodal_ehr.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shakti-VLMs: Scalable Vision-Language Models for Enterprise AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17092v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUNIA: Pixel-Sized Embeddings via Cross-Modal Alignment for Earth Observation Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17066v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant efforts have been directed towards adapting self-supervised multimodal learning for Earth observation applications. However, existing methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks (canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping). The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong low-shot capabilities with performances near or better than state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
