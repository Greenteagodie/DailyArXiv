| **[Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[LabUtopia: High-Fidelity Simulation and Hierarchical Benchmark for Scientific Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22634v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning, making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene, a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii) LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30 distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments. We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[HDDLGym: A Tool for Studying Multi-Agent Hierarchical Problems Defined in HDDL with OpenAI Gym](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22597v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems. HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain. Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of ICAPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SynWorld: Virtual Scenario Synthesis for Agentic Action Knowledge Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03561v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the interaction between agents and their environments, agents expand their capabilities by planning and executing actions. However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/SynWorld.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

However, they overlook critical developer workflows such as Version Control System (VCS) operations. To address this issue, we present GitGoodBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agent performance on VCS tasks. GitGoodBench covers three core Git scenarios extracted from permissive open-source Python, Java, and Kotlin repositories. Our benchmark provides three datasets: a comprehensive evaluation suite (900 samples), a rapid prototyping version (120 samples), and a training corpus (17,469 samples). We establish baseline performance on the prototyping version of our benchmark using GPT-4o equipped with custom tools, achieving a 21.11% solve rate overall. We expect GitGoodBench to serve as a crucial stepping stone toward truly comprehensive SE agents that go beyond mere programming.</p></details> | Short Paper, 5 pages |
| **[Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03424v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fire safety is crucial for ensuring the stability of building structures, yet evaluating whether a structure meets fire safety requirement is challenging. Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by journal Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Training RL Agents for Multi-Objective Network Defense Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22531v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge. We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge. With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI instructional agent improves student's perceived learner control and learning outcome: empirical evidence from a randomized controlled trial](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22526v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the impact of an AI instructional agent on students' perceived learner control and academic performance in a medium demanding course with lecturing as the main teaching strategy. Based on a randomized controlled trial, three instructional conditions were compared: a traditional human teacher, a self-paced MOOC with chatbot support, and an AI instructional agent capable of delivering lectures and responding to questions in real time. Students in the AI instructional agent group reported significantly higher levels of perceived learner control compared to the other groups. They also completed the learning task more efficiently and engaged in more frequent interactions with the instructional system. Regression analyzes showed that perceived learner control positively predicted post-test performance, with behavioral indicators such as reduced learning time and higher interaction frequency supporting this relationship. These findings suggest that AI instructional agents, when designed to support personalized pace and responsive interaction, can enhance both students' learning experience and learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming the Machine Penalty with Imperfectly Fair AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid technological progress, effective human-machine cooperation remains a significant challenge. Humans tend to cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon known as the machine penalty. Here, we show that artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models can overcome this penalty in social dilemma games with communication. In a pre-registered experiment with 1,152 participants, we deploy AI agents exhibiting three distinct personas: selfish, cooperative, and fair. However, only fair agents elicit human cooperation at rates comparable to human-human interactions. Analysis reveals that fair agents, similar to human participants, occasionally break pre-game cooperation promises, but nonetheless effectively establish cooperation as a social norm. These results challenge the conventional wisdom of machines as altruistic assistants or rational actors. Instead, our study highlights the importance of AI agents reflecting the nuanced complexity of human social behaviors -- imperfect yet driven by deeper social cognitive processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Strangers to Assistants: Fast Desire Alignment for Embodied Agent-User Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22503v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution. The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSearch: An Iterative Self-Evolving Search Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22501v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges: supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains, while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic capabilities in open web search domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdvAgent: Controllable Blackbox Red-teaming on Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17401v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model-based agents are increasingly used to automate complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Topological Structure Learning Should Be A Research Priority for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22467v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiMindTune: A Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Hyperparameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19205v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 tables |
| **[LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17535v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks. It has the potential to enhance data analysis paradigms by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for users from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data analysis problems is demonstrated using real-world data examples. The code for LAMBDA is available at https://github.com/AMA-CMFAI/LAMBDA and videos of three case studies can be viewed at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.</p></details> | 56 pages |
| **[AgentRecBench: Benchmarking LLM Agent-based Personalized Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19623v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[AgentDNS: A Root Domain Naming System for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22368v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Memento No More: Coaching AI Agents to Master Multiple Tasks via Hints Internalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01562v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning in Stackelberg Games with Non-myopic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09407v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a non-myopic long-lived agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, dealing with non-myopic agents poses additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategize and select actions that are inferior in the present in order to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future. We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, general finite Stackelberg games, and strategic classification. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications. On the way, we improve the state-of-the-art query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of these games. The latter result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended abstract of this work appeared at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC) 2022</p></details> |

This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main. Camera Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[AI for Climate Finance: Agentic Retrieval and Multi-Step Reasoning for Early Warning System Investments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05104v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Leave-one-out Approximation in LLM Multi-agent Debate Based on Introspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22192v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) advance automatic task completion in various fields, where debate is a common cooperation form for agents to solve complicated problems with reasoning and cross-review to solidify answers. Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages an FM-powered multi-agent system called AlignMind to address this issue. By having a cognitive architecture that enhances FMs with Theory-of-Mind capabilities, our approach considers the mental states and perspectives of software makers. This allows our solution to iteratively clarify the beliefs, desires, and intentions of stakeholders, translating these into a set of refined requirements and a corresponding actionable natural language workflow in the often-overlooked requirements refinement phase of software engineering, which is crucial after initial elicitation. Through a multifaceted evaluation covering 150 diverse use cases, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately capture the intents and requirements of stakeholders, articulating them as both specifications and a step-by-step plan of action. Our findings suggest that the potential for significant improvements in the software development process justifies these investments. Our work lays the groundwork for future innovation in building intent-first development environments, where software makers can seamlessly collaborate with AIs to create software that truly meets their needs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Oryx, a novel algorithm for offline cooperative MARL to directly address this challenge. Oryx adapts the recently proposed retention-based architecture Sable and combines it with a sequential form of implicit constraint Q-learning (ICQ), to develop a novel offline auto-regressive policy update scheme. This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works (SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo) covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons. Finally, we introduce new datasets to push the limits of many-agent coordination in offline MARL, and demonstrate Oryx's superior ability to scale effectively in such settings. We will make all of our datasets, experimental data, and code available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.</p></details> | Preprint |

These limitations constrain its effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs, and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached 81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials (+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676, Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment formation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18079v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2 dr...</summary><p>V2 draft. Under review</p></details> |
| **[The Stepwise Deception: Simulating the Evolution from True News to Fake News with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19064v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing spread of misinformation online, understanding how true news evolves into fake news has become crucial for early detection and prevention. However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Centric Personalized Multiple Clustering with Multi-Modal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22241v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences. However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations. To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of 0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively, largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.</p></details> |  |

Psychiatric differential diagnosis exemplifies this challenge: accurate assessments depend on nuanced clinical knowledge, a delicate cognitive-affective interview process, and downstream outcomes that extend far beyond benchmark accuracy. We present WiseMind, a systematic interdisciplinary contextualization framework that delivers both instrumental (diagnostic precision) and humanistic (empathy) gains. WiseMind comprises three components:(i) structured knowledge-guided proactive reasoning, which embeds DSM-5 criteria in a knowledge graph to steer questioning; (ii) a theory-informed dual-agent architecture that coordinates a "reasonable-mind" reasoning agent and an "emotional-mind" empathy agent, inspired by Dialectical Behavior Therapy; and (iii) a multi-faceted evaluation strategy covering simulated patients, user studies, clinician review, and ethical assessment. Tested on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, WiseMind attains up to 84.2% diagnostic accuracy, which is comparable to human experts, while outperforming single-agent baselines in perceived empathy and trustworthiness. These results show that deep contextualization-across knowledge, process, and evaluation layers-can transform benchmark-driven NLP into clinically meaningful impact.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[AudioGenie: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Multimodality-to-Multiaudio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22053v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodality-to-Multiaudio (MM2MA) generation faces significant challenges in synthesizing diverse and contextually aligned audio types (e.g., sound effects, speech, music, and songs) from multimodal inputs (e.g., video, text, images), owing to the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets and the lack of robust multi-task learning frameworks. Recently, multi-agent system shows great potential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA task presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained understanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of single models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of self-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs. To this end, we propose AudioGenie, a novel training-free multi-agent system featuring a dual-layer architecture with a generation team and a supervisor team. For the generation team, a fine-grained task decomposition and an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) collaborative entity are designed for dynamic model selection, and a trial-and-error iterative refinement module is designed for self-correction. The supervisor team ensures temporal-spatial consistency and verifies outputs through feedback loops. Moreover, we build MA-Bench, the first benchmark for MM2MA tasks, comprising 198 annotated videos with multi-type audios. Experiments demonstrate that our AudioGenie outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across 9 metrics in 8 tasks. User study further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of quality, accuracy, alignment, and aesthetic.

| **[Efficiently Enhancing General Agents With Hierarchical-categorical Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22006v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities, there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Independent Messaging for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21985v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective communication improves agent performance, particularly under partial observability. We propose MARL-CPC, a framework that enables communication among fully decentralized, independent agents without parameter sharing. MARL-CPC incorporates a message learning model based on collective predictive coding (CPC) from emergent communication research. Unlike conventional methods that treat messages as part of the action space and assume cooperation, MARL-CPC links messages to state inference, supporting communication in non-cooperative, reward-independent settings. We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks. Benchmarks show that both outperform standard message-as-action approaches, establishing effective communication even when messages offer no direct benefit to the sender. These results highlight MARL-CPC's potential for enabling coordination in complex, decentralized environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DORAEMON: Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21969v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-Evol: Automatic Knowledge Evolving for Computer Use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21964v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution. Our analysis shows even 90\% correct knowledge yields only 41\% execution success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMDAgent: An Autonomous Framework for Post-Training Pipeline Optimization via LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21963v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%, demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Saving: Resource Aware Multi-Agent Collaboration for Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21898v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources. Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality. Our key innovation is the introduction of "shortcuts" -- instructional transitions learned from historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process. Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision Support System, Agentic-AI Applications</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations. EduVisBench and EduVisAgent are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisBench and https://github.com/aiming-lab/EduVisAgent.</p></details> | 16 pages; 7 figures |

Agents - AI systems that can autonomously achieve goals in the world, with little to no explicit human instruction about how to do so - are a major focus of leading tech companies, AI start-ups, and investors. If these development efforts are successful, some industry leaders claim we could soon see a world where millions or billions of agents autonomously perform complex tasks across society. Society is largely unprepared for this development. A future where capable agents are deployed en masse could see transformative benefits to society but also profound and novel risks. Currently, the exploration of agent governance questions and the development of associated interventions remain in their infancy. Only a few researchers, primarily in civil society organizations, public research institutes, and frontier AI companies, are actively working on these challenges.</p></details> |  |

Understanding intrinsic motivation is a long-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence; numerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there remains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults, children, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study how common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment, relate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are consistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating that these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents. Furthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially increases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously, suggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration, while advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find preliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal verbalizations, may aid exploration in children. Our data is available at https://github.com/alyd/humans_in_crafter_data.</p></details> |  |

However, the agentic frameworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with research cyberinfrastructure.

To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows, and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we also present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safety Reasoning in LLMs: AI-agentic Deliberation for Policy-embedded CoT Data Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21784v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmazonScience/AIDSAFE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

While adept at reactive tasks (e.g., diagnosis reasoning), LLMs often struggle with proactive engagement, like unprompted identification of critical missing information or risks. We introduce BehaviorBench, a comprehensive dataset to evaluate agent behaviors across a clinical assistance spectrum, ranging from reactive query responses to proactive interventions (e.g., clarifying ambiguities, flagging overlooked critical data). Our BehaviorBench experiments reveal LLMs' inconsistent proactivity. To address this, we propose BehaviorSFT, a novel training strategy using behavioral tokens to explicitly condition LLMs for dynamic behavioral selection along this spectrum. BehaviorSFT boosts performance, achieving up to 97.3% overall Macro F1 on BehaviorBench and improving proactive task scores (e.g., from 95.0% to 96.5% for Qwen2.5-7B-Ins). Crucially, blind clinician evaluations confirmed BehaviorSFT-trained agents exhibit more realistic clinical behavior, striking a superior balance between helpful proactivity (e.g., timely, relevant suggestions) and necessary restraint (e.g., avoiding over-intervention) versus standard fine-tuning or explicit instructed agents.</p></details> |  |

While most robustness evaluations focus on tasks complexifications, for which human also struggle to maintain performances, no evaluation has been performed on tasks simplifications. To tackle this issue, we introduce HackAtari, a set of task variations of the Arcade Learning Environments. We use it to demonstrate that, contrary to humans, RL agents systematically exhibit huge performance drops on simpler versions of their training tasks, uncovering agents' consistent reliance on shortcuts. Our analysis across multiple algorithms and architectures highlights the persistent gap between RL agents and human behavioral intelligence, underscoring the need for new benchmarks and methodologies that enforce systematic generalization testing beyond static evaluation protocols. Training and testing in the same environment is not enough to obtain agents equipped with human-like intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages in total, 5 main figures, 14 figures total</p></details> |

Early attempts to automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating high-quality visual presentations. PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Silence is Not Consensus: Disrupting Agreement Bias in Multi-Agent LLMs via Catfish Agent for Clinical Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21503v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdInject: Real-World Black-Box Attacks on Web Agents via Advertising Delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21499v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Model (VLM) based Web Agents represent a significant step towards automating complex tasks by simulating human-like interaction with websites. However, their deployment in uncontrolled web environments introduces significant security vulnerabilities. Existing research on adversarial environmental injection attacks often relies on unrealistic assumptions, such as direct HTML manipulation, knowledge of user intent, or access to agent model parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose AdInject, a novel and real-world black-box attack method that leverages the internet advertising delivery to inject malicious content into the Web Agent's environment. AdInject operates under a significantly more realistic threat model than prior work, assuming a black-box agent, static malicious content constraints, and no specific knowledge of user intent. AdInject includes strategies for designing malicious ad content aimed at misleading agents into clicking, and a VLM-based ad content optimization technique that infers potential user intents from the target website's context and integrates these intents into the ad content to make it appear more relevant or critical to the agent's task, thus enhancing attack effectiveness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdInject, attack success rates exceeding 60% in most scenarios and approaching 100% in certain cases. This strongly demonstrates that prevalent advertising delivery constitutes a potent and real-world vector for environment injection attacks against Web Agents. This work highlights a critical vulnerability in Web Agent security arising from real-world environment manipulation channels, underscoring the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms against such threats. Our code is available at https://github.com/NicerWang/AdInject.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-Genie: A Self-Improving Approach for Iteratively Boosting MLLM-based Mobile GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21496v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research in https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie</p></details> |
| **[Scaling External Knowledge Input Beyond Context Windows of LLMs via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, $\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Agentic Medical Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Agentic Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries. Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUARD:Dual-Agent based Backdoor Defense on Chain-of-Thought in Neural Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21425v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large language models in code generation, recent studies demonstrate that employing additional Chain-of-Thought generation models can significantly enhance code generation performance by providing explicit reasoning steps. However, as external components, CoT models are particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which existing defense mechanisms often fail to detect effectively. To address this challenge, we propose GUARD, a novel dual-agent defense framework specifically designed to counter CoT backdoor attacks in neural code generation. GUARD integrates two core components: GUARD-Judge, which identifies suspicious CoT steps and potential triggers through comprehensive analysis, and GUARD-Repair, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach to regenerate secure CoT steps for identified anomalies. Experimental results show that GUARD effectively mitigates attacks while maintaining generation quality, advancing secure code generation systems.</p></details> | under review |

Nevertheless, its clinical implementation entails intricate tasks such as multimodal image interpretation, personalized dose planning, and real-time intraoperative decision-making processes that demand intelligent assistance to improve efficiency and reliability. We introduce FUAS-Agents, an autonomous agent system that leverages the multimodal understanding and tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By integrating patient profiles and MRI data, FUAS-Agents orchestrates a suite of specialized medical AI tools, including segmentation, treatment dose prediction, and clinical guideline retrieval, to generate personalized treatment plans comprising MRI image, dose parameters, and therapeutic strategies. We evaluate the system in a uterine fibroid treatment scenario. Human assessment by four senior FUAS experts indicates that 82.5%, 82.5%, 87.5%, and 97.5% of the generated plans were rated 4 or above (on a 5-point scale) in terms of completeness, accuracy, fluency, and clinical compliance, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven agents in enhancing decision-making across complex clinical workflows, and exemplify a translational paradigm that combines general-purpose models with specialized expert systems to solve practical challenges in vertical healthcare domains.</p></details> |  |

While existing skill discovery methods learns these skills automatically, they are limited to a single skill per task. In contrast, humans learn and use both fine-grained and coarse motor skills simultaneously. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Multi-Resolution Skill Discovery (MRSD), an HRL framework that learns multiple skill encoders at different temporal resolutions in parallel. A high-level manager dynamically selects among these skills, enabling adaptive control strategies over time. We evaluate MRSD on tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and show that it outperforms prior state-of-the-art skill discovery and HRL methods, achieving faster convergence and higher final performance. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multi-resolution skills in HRL, paving the way for more versatile and efficient agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoJudger: An Agent-Driven Framework for Efficient Benchmarking of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21389v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process. Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e. AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Despite their growing importance, safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE IRI 2025</p></details> |

This paper studies the impact of data sharing among agents on regret minimization. Unlike most existing approaches, our contribution does not rely on any assumptions on the bandit parameters structure. Our main result formalizes the trade-off between the bias and uncertainty of the bandit parameter estimation for efficient collaboration. This result is the cornerstone of the Bandit Adaptive Sample Sharing (BASS) algorithm, whose efficiency over the current state-of-the-art is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, when agents' parameters display a cluster structure, our algorithm accurately recovers them.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[DHP: Discrete Hierarchical Planning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01956v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) agents often struggle with long-horizon visual planning due to their reliance on error-prone distance metrics. We propose Discrete Hierarchical Planning (DHP), a method that replaces continuous distance estimates with discrete reachability checks to evaluate subgoal feasibility. DHP recursively constructs tree-structured plans by decomposing long-term goals into sequences of simpler subtasks, using a novel advantage estimation strategy that inherently rewards shorter plans and generalizes beyond training depths. In addition, to address the data efficiency challenge, we introduce an exploration strategy that generates targeted training examples for the planning modules without needing expert data. Experiments in 25-room navigation environments demonstrate $100\%$ success rate (vs $82\%$ baseline) and $73$-step average episode length (vs $158$-step baseline). The method also generalizes to momentum-based control tasks and requires only $\log N$ steps for replanning. Theoretical analysis and ablations validate our design choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21298v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[PACT: A Contract-Theoretic Framework for Pricing Agentic AI Services Powered by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21286v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI, often powered by large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly popular and adopted to support autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and task execution across various domains. While agentic AI holds great promise, its deployment as services for easy access raises critical challenges in pricing, due to high infrastructure and computation costs, multi-dimensional and task-dependent Quality of Service (QoS), and growing concerns around liability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose PACT, a Pricing framework for cloud-based Agentic AI services through a Contract-Theoretic approach, which models QoS along both objective (e.g., response time) and subjective (e.g., user satisfaction) dimensions. PACT accounts for computational, infrastructure, and potential liability costs for the service provider, while ensuring incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the user under information asymmetry. Through contract-based selection, users receive tailored service offerings aligned with their needs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that PACT improves QoS alignment between users and providers and offers a scalable, liable approach to pricing agentic AI services in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[XBOUND: Exploring the Capability Boundaries of Device-Control Agents through Trajectory Tree Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21279v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and limitations inherent in both series.

| **[Online Decision-Making in Tree-Like Multi-Agent Games with Transfers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19388v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Machine Learning systems everywhere raises challenges, such as dealing with interactions or competition between multiple learners. In that goal, we study multi-agent sequential decision-making by considering principal-agent interactions in a tree structure. In this problem, the reward of a player is influenced by the actions of her children, who are all self-interested and non-cooperative, hence the complexity of making good decisions. Our main finding is that it is possible to steer all the players towards the globally optimal set of actions by simply allowing single-step transfers between them. A transfer is established between a principal and one of her agents: the principal actually offers the proposed payment if the agent picks the recommended action. The analysis poses specific challenges due to the intricate interactions between the nodes of the tree and the propagation of the regret within this tree. Considering a bandit setup, we propose algorithmic solutions for the players to end up being no-regret with respect to the optimal pair of actions and incentives. In the long run, allowing transfers between players makes them act as if they were collaborating together, although they remain self-interested non-cooperative: transfers restore efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing simulators do not yet fully meet the needs of future transportation research-particularly in enabling effective human-AI collaboration and modeling socially-aware driving agents. This paper introduces Sky-Drive, a novel distributed multi-agent simulation platform that addresses these limitations through four key innovations: (a) a distributed architecture for synchronized simulation across multiple terminals; (b) a multi-modal human-in-the-loop framework integrating diverse sensors to collect rich behavioral data; (c) a human-AI collaboration mechanism supporting continuous and adaptive knowledge exchange; and (d) a digital twin framework for constructing high-fidelity virtual replicas of real-world transportation environments. Sky-Drive supports diverse applications such as autonomous vehicle-human road users interaction modeling, human-in-the-loop training, socially-aware reinforcement learning, personalized driving development, and customized scenario generation. Future extensions will incorporate foundation models for context-aware decision support and hardware-in-the-loop testing for real-world validation. By bridging scenario generation, data collection, algorithm training, and hardware integration, Sky-Drive has the potential to become a foundational platform for the next generation of human-centered and socially-aware autonomous transportation systems research.

| **[Voting or Consensus? Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19130v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models. Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the \emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The \textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where natural language queries are used to search information from structured data -- 91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types, consistently delivering reliable performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, FinIR'25 |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> |  |

To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms, including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily. During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization, MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled, observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.</p></details> |  |

While existing surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely overlook the dimension of \emph{creativity}, including how novel outputs are generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present: (1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement, and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and the lack of unified benchmarks. This survey offers a structured framework and roadmap for advancing the development, evaluation, and standardization of creative MAS.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Herd Behavior: Investigating Peer Influence in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21588v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of multi-agent systems where LLMs interact, collaborate, and make decisions in shared environments. While individual model behavior has been extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for designing more effective and adaptive multi-agent collaboration frameworks.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms. Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications. Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building. Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage. Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues. Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process. Particularly, we observe that most popular C/C++ projects encounter an average of five errors when relying solely on the default build systems. Based on our study, we develop an automated build system called CXXCrafter to specifically address the above-mentioned challenges, such as dependency resolution. Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building. Specifically, among the Top100 dataset, 72 projects are built successfully by both CXXCrafter and manual efforts, 3 by CXXCrafter only, and 14 manually only. ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Environment Alignment via Automated Interface Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21055v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an \underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface \underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile, ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures and LLM backbones without interface regeneration.

PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholar queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50, and exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.

While large language models possess good foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning. AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies. The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance. Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable, personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering education.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Agent World Modeling from a Diffusion-Inspired Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20922v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models have recently attracted growing interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) due to their ability to improve sample efficiency for policy learning. However, accurately modeling environments in MARL is challenging due to the exponentially large joint action space and highly uncertain dynamics inherent in multi-agent systems. To address this, we reduce modeling complexity by shifting from jointly modeling the entire state-action transition dynamics to focusing on the state space alone at each timestep through sequential agent modeling. Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models. Leveraging this insight, we develop a flexible and robust world model for MARL using diffusion models. Our method, Diffusion-Inspired Multi-Agent world model (DIMA), achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple multi-agent control benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior world models in terms of final return and sample efficiency, including MAMuJoCo and Bi-DexHands. DIMA establishes a new paradigm for constructing multi-agent world models, advancing the frontier of MARL research.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo.

To fill this gap, this paper systematically investigates LLM intelligence through the lens of ``human simulation'', addressing three core questions: (1) \textit{How do personality traits affect problem-solving in closed tasks?} (2) \textit{How do traits shape creativity in open tasks?} (3) \textit{How does single-agent performance influence multi-agent collaboration?} By assigning Big Five personality traits to LLM agents and evaluating their performance in single- and multi-agent settings, we reveal that specific traits significantly influence reasoning accuracy (closed tasks) and creative output (open tasks). Furthermore, multi-agent systems exhibit collective intelligence distinct from individual capabilities, driven by distinguishing combinations of personalities.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

A critical aspect of their functionality is grounding - the ability to map linguistic intents to visual and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability (generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available at GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with 100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.</p></details> |  |

However, this potential remains underexplored, particularly in the context of structured reasoning, interpretability, and comprehensive tool-grounded molecular optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework for molecular optimization that leverages tool-guided reasoning and role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools, categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction between the analyst agents, a molecule-generating scientist, a reasoning-output verifier, and a reviewer agent. As a result, we show that our framework shows the state-of-the-art performance of the PMO-1K benchmark on 17 out of 23 tasks.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Yet, this progress disrupts traditional agent frameworks, traditionally anchored by execution-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). To explore this transformation, we propose the LaRMA framework, encompassing nine tasks across Tool Usage, Plan Design, and Problem Solving, assessed with three top LLMs (e.g., Claude3.5-sonnet) and five leading LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>71 pa...</summary><p>71 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning, and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MaskSearch. In the pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP) task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MaskSearch significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/MaskSearch</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

| **[Can Agents Fix Agent Issues?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20749v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |

We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, our study with human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors between humans and LLMs. We believe our benchmark will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and IDEA will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios.

While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPA-RL: Reinforcing LLM Agents via Stepwise Progress Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20732v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training.

While recent work has advanced such general robot policies, their training and evaluation are often limited to tasks within specific scenes, involving restricted instructions and scenarios. Existing benchmarks also typically rely on manual annotation of limited tasks in a few scenes. We argue that exploring the full spectrum of feasible tasks within any given scene is crucial, as they provide both extensive benchmarks for evaluation and valuable resources for agent improvement. Towards this end, we introduce ManiTaskGen, a novel system that automatically generates comprehensive, diverse, feasible mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. The generated tasks encompass both process-based, specific instructions (e.g., "move object from X to Y") and outcome-based, abstract instructions (e.g., "clear the table"). We apply ManiTaskGen to both simulated and real-world scenes, demonstrating the validity and diversity of the generated tasks. We then leverage these tasks to automatically construct benchmarks, thoroughly evaluating the embodied decision-making capabilities of agents built upon existing vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method that utilizes ManiTaskGen tasks to enhance embodied decision-making. Overall, this work presents a universal task generation framework for arbitrary scenes, facilitating both benchmarking and improvement of embodied decision-making agents.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pre-training for Recommendation Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22649v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2025 Oral</p></details> |

Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, identifying effective cross-industry partnerships remains challenging due to resource imbalances, uncertain brand willingness, and ever-changing market conditions. In this paper, we provide the first systematic study of this problem and propose a unified online-offline framework to enable co-branding recommendations. Our approach begins by constructing a bipartite graph linking ``initiating'' and ``target'' brands to quantify co-branding probabilities and assess market benefits. During the online learning phase, we dynamically update the graph in response to market feedback, while striking a balance between exploring new collaborations for long-term gains and exploiting established partnerships for immediate benefits. To address the high initial co-branding costs, our framework mitigates redundant exploration, thereby enhancing short-term performance while ensuring sustainable strategic growth. In the offline optimization phase, our framework consolidates the interests of multiple sub-brands under the same parent brand to maximize overall returns, avoid excessive investment in single sub-brands, and reduce unnecessary costs associated with over-prioritizing a single sub-brand. We present a theoretical analysis of our approach, establishing a highly nontrivial sublinear regret bound for online learning in the complex co-branding problem, and enhancing the approximation guarantee for the NP-hard offline budget allocation optimization. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world co-branding datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our framework, with at least 12\% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2025</p></details> |

Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag, which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible, industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote reproducible results in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we prove that non-uniform observed value distributions of individual entities lead to severe biases in state-of-the-art models, skewing predictions towards the average of observed past values for the entity and providing worse-than-random predictive power in eccentric yet crucial cases; we name this phenomenon eccentricity bias. We show that global error metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are insufficient to capture this bias, and we introduce Eccentricity-Area Under the Curve (EAUC) as a novel metric that can quantify it in all studied domains and models. We prove the intuitive interpretation of EAUC by experimenting with naive post-training bias corrections, and theorize other options to use EAUC to guide the construction of fair models. This work contributes a bias-aware evaluation of dyadic regression to prevent unfairness in critical real-world applications of such systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02226v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have become increasingly vital in our daily lives, helping to alleviate the problem of information overload across various user-oriented online services. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable achievements, demonstrating their potential for the development of next-generation recommender systems. Despite these advancements, LLM-based recommender systems face inherent limitations stemming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommendations. To address these limitations, we propose to retrieve high-quality and up-to-date structure information from the knowledge graph (KG) to augment recommendations. Specifically, our approach develops a retrieval-augmented framework, termed K-RagRec, that facilitates the recommendation generation process by incorporating structure information from the external KG. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[ConsRec: Denoising Sequential Recommendation through User-Consistent Preference Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22130v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-item interaction histories are pivotal for sequential recommendation systems but often include noise, such as unintended clicks or actions that fail to reflect genuine user preferences. To address this issue, we propose the User-Consistent Preference-based Sequential Recommendation System (ConsRec), designed to capture stable user preferences and filter noisy items from interaction histories. Specifically, ConsRec constructs a user-interacted item graph, learns item similarities from their text representations, and then extracts the maximum connected subgraph from the user-interacted item graph for denoising items. Experimental results on the Yelp and Amazon Product datasets illustrate that ConsRec achieves a 13% improvement over baseline recommendation models, showing its effectiveness in denoising user-interacted items. Further analysis reveals that the denoised interaction histories form semantically tighter clusters of user-preferred items, leading to higher relevance scores for ground-truth targets and more accurate recommendations. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/ConsRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley Value-driven Data Pruning for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22057v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems often suffer from noisy interactions like accidental clicks or popularity bias. Existing denoising methods typically identify users' intent in their interactions, and filter out noisy interactions that deviate from the assumed intent. However, they ignore that interactions deemed noisy could still aid model training, while some ``clean'' interactions offer little learning value. To bridge this gap, we propose Shapley Value-driven Valuation (SVV), a framework that evaluates interactions based on their objective impact on model training rather than subjective intent assumptions. In SVV, a real-time Shapley value estimation method is devised to quantify each interaction's value based on its contribution to reducing training loss. Afterward, SVV highlights the interactions with high values while downplaying low ones to achieve effective data pruning for recommender systems. In addition, we develop a simulated noise protocol to examine the performance of various denoising approaches systematically. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SVV outperforms existing denoising methods in both accuracy and robustness. Further analysis also demonstrates that our SVV can preserve training-critical interactions and offer interpretable noise assessment. This work shifts denoising from heuristic filtering to principled, model-driven interaction valuation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In SI...</summary><p>In SIGKDD (2025), 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[MultiScale Contextual Bandits for Long Term Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17674v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feedback that AI systems (e.g., recommender systems, chatbots) collect from user interactions is a crucial source of training data. While short-term feedback (e.g., clicks, engagement) is widely used for training, there is ample evidence that optimizing short-term feedback does not necessarily achieve the desired long-term objectives. Unfortunately, directly optimizing for long-term objectives is challenging, and we identify the disconnect in the timescales of short-term interventions (e.g., rankings) and the long-term feedback (e.g., user retention) as one of the key obstacles. To overcome this disconnect, we introduce the framework of MultiScale Policy Learning to contextually reconcile that AI systems need to act and optimize feedback at multiple interdependent timescales. Following a PAC-Bayes motivation, we show how the lower timescales with more plentiful data can provide a data-dependent hierarchical prior for faster learning at higher scales, where data is more scarce. As a result, the policies at all levels effectively optimize for the long-term. We instantiate the framework with MultiScale Off-Policy Bandit Learning (MSBL) and demonstrate its effectiveness on three tasks relating to recommender and conversational systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embed Progressive Implicit Preference in Unified Space for Deep Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20900v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding-based collaborative filtering, often coupled with nearest neighbor search, is widely deployed in large-scale recommender systems for personalized content selection. Modern systems leverage multiple implicit feedback signals (e.g., clicks, add to cart, purchases) to model user preferences comprehensively. However, prevailing approaches adopt a feedback-wise modeling paradigm, which (1) fails to capture the structured progression of user engagement entailed among different feedback and (2) embeds feedback-specific information into disjoint spaces, making representations incommensurable, increasing system complexity, and leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. A promising alternative is Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR), which explicitly models discrete ordered relations. However, existing OLR-based recommendation models mainly focus on explicit feedback (e.g., movie ratings) and struggle with implicit, correlated feedback, where ordering is vague and non-linear. Moreover, standard OLR lacks flexibility in handling feedback-dependent covariates, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world systems. To address these limitations, we propose Generalized Neural Ordinal Logistic Regression (GNOLR), which encodes multiple feature-feedback dependencies into a unified, structured embedding space and enforces feedback-specific dependency learning through a nested optimization framework. Thus, GNOLR enhances predictive accuracy, captures the progression of user engagement, and simplifies the retrieval process. We establish a theoretical comparison with existing paradigms, demonstrating how GNOLR avoids disjoint spaces while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that GNOLR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling and Optimizing User Preferences in AI Copilots: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21907v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI copilots, context-aware, AI-powered systems designed to assist users in tasks such as software development and content creation, are becoming integral to modern workflows. As these systems grow in capability and adoption, personalization has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring usability, trust, and productivity. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the ability of AI copilots to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While personalization techniques are well-established in domains like recommender systems and dialogue agents, their adaptation to interactive, real-time systems like AI copilots remains fragmented and underexplored. This survey addresses this gap by synthesizing research on how user preferences are captured, modeled, and refined within the design of AI copilots. We introduce a unified definition of AI copilots and propose a phase-based taxonomy of preference optimization strategies, structured around pre-interaction, mid-interaction, and post-interaction stages. We analyze techniques for acquiring preference signals, modeling user intent, and integrating feedback loops, highlighting both established approaches and recent innovations. By bridging insights from AI personalization, human-AI collaboration, and large language model adaptation, this survey provides a structured foundation for designing adaptive, preference-aware AI copilots. It offers a holistic view of the available preference resources, how they can be leveraged, and which technical approaches are most suited to each stage of system design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10158v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Emotion-based Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16121v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender system is one of the most critical technologies for large internet companies such as Amazon and TikTok. Although millions of users use recommender systems globally everyday, and indeed, much data analysis work has been done to improve the technical accuracy of the system, to our limited knowledge, there has been little attention paid to analysis of users' emotion in recommender systems. In this paper, we create a new theory and metrics that could capture users' emotion when they are interacting with recommender systems. We also provide effective and efficient visualization techniques for visualization of users' emotion and its change in the customers' lifetime cycle. In the end, we design a framework for emotion-based recommendation algorithms, illustrated in a straightforward example with experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Self-attention for Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21811v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation is a popular paradigm in modern recommender systems. In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given user interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly built on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly injecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module blocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the core self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally powerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to improve the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of enhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal self-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective problem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing the cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in CDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also encourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on the idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight additional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play module that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders. Besides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra computational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. AutoCDSR on average improves Recall@10 for SASRec and Bert4Rec by 9.8% and 16.0% and NDCG@10 by 12.0% and 16.7%, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/snap-research/AutoCDSR.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD'25 |
| **[User Feedback Alignment for LLM-powered Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. To enhance planning for new user interests using LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling. This method aims to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL'2...</summary><p>ACL'25 (Industry) Oral</p></details> |

Conversational contextual bandits, a prevalent approach in this domain, aim to optimize preference learning by balancing exploitation and exploration. However, several limitations hinder their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. First, existing algorithms employ key term selection strategies with insufficient exploration, often failing to thoroughly probe users' preferences and resulting in suboptimal preference estimation. Second, current algorithms typically rely on deterministic rules to initiate conversations, causing unnecessary interactions when preferences are well-understood and missed opportunities when preferences are uncertain. To address these limitations, we propose three novel algorithms: CLiSK, CLiME, and CLiSK-ME. CLiSK introduces smoothed key term contexts to enhance exploration in preference learning, CLiME adaptively initiates conversations based on preference uncertainty, and CLiSK-ME integrates both techniques. We theoretically prove that all three algorithms achieve a tighter regret upper bound of $O(\sqrt{dT\log{T}})$ with respect to the time horizon $T$, improving upon existing methods. Additionally, we provide a matching lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ for conversational bandits, demonstrating that our algorithms are nearly minimax optimal. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approaches achieve at least a 14.6% improvement in cumulative regret.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Crop recommendation with machine learning: leveraging environmental and economic factors for optimal crop selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21201v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agriculture constitutes a primary source of food production, economic growth and employment in India, but the sector is confronted with low farm productivity and yields aggravated by increased pressure on natural resources and adverse climate change variability. Efforts involving green revolution, land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity. However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield, profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19 crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The 10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time. Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation in the Indian context.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Counterfactual Multi-player Bandits for Explainable Recommendation Diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21165v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing recommender systems tend to prioritize items closely aligned with users' historical interactions, inevitably trapping users in the dilemma of ``filter bubble''. Recent efforts are dedicated to improving the diversity of recommendations. However, they mainly suffer from two major issues: 1) a lack of explainability, making it difficult for the system designers to understand how diverse recommendations are generated, and 2) limitations to specific metrics, with difficulty in enhancing non-differentiable diversity metrics. To this end, we propose a \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{M}ulti-player \textbf{B}andits (CMB) method to deliver explainable recommendation diversification across a wide range of diversity metrics. Leveraging a counterfactual framework, our method identifies the factors influencing diversity outcomes. Meanwhile, we adopt the multi-player bandits to optimize the counterfactual optimization objective, making it adaptable to both differentiable and non-differentiable diversity metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the applicability, effectiveness, and explainability of the proposed CMB.</p></details> |  |
| **[GGBond: Growing Graph-Based AI-Agent Society for Socially-Aware Recommender Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21154v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms, including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily. During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization, MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled, observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vague Preference Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04487v6)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) commonly assume users have clear preferences, leading to potential over-filtering of relevant alternatives. However, users often exhibit vague, non-binary preferences. We introduce the Vague Preference Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR) scenario, employing a soft estimation mechanism to accommodate users' vague and dynamic preferences while mitigating over-filtering. In VPMCR, we propose Vague Preference Policy Learning (VPPL), consisting of Ambiguity-aware Soft Estimation (ASE) and Dynamism-aware Policy Learning (DPL). ASE captures preference vagueness by estimating scores for clicked and non-clicked options, using a choice-based approach and time-aware preference decay. DPL leverages ASE's preference distribution to guide the conversation and adapt to preference changes for recommendations or attribute queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate VPPL's effectiveness within VPMCR, outperforming existing methods and setting a new benchmark. Our work advances CRS by accommodating users' inherent ambiguity and relative decision-making processes, improving real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cold-Start Recommendation with Knowledge-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20773v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start items remain a persistent challenge in recommender systems due to their lack of historical user interactions, which collaborative models rely on. While recent zero-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to address this, they often struggle with sparse metadata and hallucinated or incomplete knowledge. We propose ColdRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation approach that builds a domain-specific knowledge graph dynamically to enhance LLM-based recommendation in cold-start scenarios, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. ColdRAG begins by converting structured item attributes into rich natural-language profiles, from which it extracts entities and relationships to construct a unified knowledge graph capturing item semantics. Given a user's interaction history, it scores edges in the graph using an LLM, retrieves candidate items with supporting evidence, and prompts the LLM to rank them. By enabling multi-hop reasoning over this graph, ColdRAG grounds recommendations in verifiable evidence, reducing hallucinations and strengthening semantic connections. Experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that ColdRAG surpasses existing zero-shot baselines in both Recall and NDCG. This framework offers a practical solution to cold-start recommendation by combining knowledge-graph reasoning with retrieval-augmented LLM generation.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning for LLM-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20771v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS). There are currently two commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1) The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data. However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet our expectations. To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning" method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of curriculum learning. It first employs self-distillation to construct an auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM. Then it further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging data (real RS data). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.

| **[What LLMs Miss in Recommendations: Bridging the Gap with Retrieval-Augmented Collaborative Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20730v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTGR: Industrial-Scale Generative Recommendation Framework in Meituan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18654v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling law has been extensively validated in many domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. In the recommendation system, recent work has adopted generative recommendations to achieve scalability, but their generative approaches require abandoning the carefully constructed cross features of traditional recommendation models. We found that this approach significantly degrades model performance, and scaling up cannot compensate for it at all. In this paper, we propose MTGR (Meituan Generative Recommendation) to address this issue. MTGR is modeling based on the HSTU architecture and can retain the original deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) features, including cross features. Additionally, MTGR achieves training and inference acceleration through user-level compression to ensure efficient scaling. We also propose Group-Layer Normalization (GLN) to enhance the performance of encoding within different semantic spaces and the dynamic masking strategy to avoid information leakage. We further optimize the training frameworks, enabling support for our models with 10 to 100 times computational complexity compared to the DLRM, without significant cost increases. MTGR achieved 65x FLOPs for single-sample forward inference compared to the DLRM model, resulting in the largest gain in nearly two years both offline and online. This breakthrough was successfully deployed on Meituan, the world's largest food delivery platform, where it has been handling the main traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Based LLMs for Position Bias-Aware Reranking in Personalized Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04948v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have decided to withdraw the manuscript as it requires substantial revisions that go beyond what is appropriate for a versioned update on arXiv.

| **[Leveraging Descriptions of Emotional Preferences in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20190v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The affective attitude of liking a recommended item reflects just one category in a wide spectrum of affective phenomena that also includes emotions such as entranced or intrigued, moods such as cheerful or buoyant, as well as more fine-grained affective states, such as "pleasantly surprised by the conclusion". In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Catoni-Style Change Point Detection for Regret Minimization in Non-Stationary Heavy-Tailed Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20051v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regret minimization in stochastic non-stationary bandits gained popularity over the last decade, as it can model a broad class of real-world problems, from advertising to recommendation systems. Existing literature relies on various assumptions about the reward-generating process, such as Bernoulli or subgaussian rewards. However, in settings such as finance and telecommunications, heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise. In this work, we tackle the heavy-tailed piecewise-stationary bandit problem. Heavy-tailed bandits, introduced by Bubeck et al., 2013, operate on the minimal assumption that the finite absolute centered moments of maximum order $1+\epsilon$ are uniformly bounded by a constant $v<+\infty$, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We focus on the most popular non-stationary bandit setting, i.e., the piecewise-stationary setting, in which the mean of reward-generating distributions may change at unknown time steps. We provide a novel Catoni-style change-point detection strategy tailored for heavy-tailed distributions that relies on recent advancements in the theory of sequential estimation, which is of independent interest. We introduce Robust-CPD-UCB, which combines this change-point detection strategy with optimistic algorithms for bandits, providing its regret upper bound and an impossibility result on the minimum attainable regret for any policy. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light distillation for Incremental Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19810v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems presently utilize vast amounts of data and play a pivotal role in enhancing user experiences. Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have surfaced as highly efficient models within the realm of recommender systems due to their ability to capture extensive relational information. The continuously expanding volume of data may render the training of GCNs excessively costly. To tackle this problem, incrementally training GCNs as new data blocks come in has become a vital research direction. Knowledge distillation techniques have been explored as a general paradigm to train GCNs incrementally and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem that typically occurs in incremental settings. However, we argue that current methods based on knowledge distillation introduce additional parameters and have a high model complexity, which results in unrealistic training time consumption in an incremental setting and thus difficult to actually deploy in the real world. In this work, we propose a light preference-driven distillation method to distill the preference score of a user for an item directly from historical interactions, which reduces the training time consumption in the incremental setting significantly without noticeable loss in performance. The experimental result on two general datasets shows that the proposed method can save training time from 1.5x to 9.5x compared to the existing methods and improves Recall@20 by 5.41% and 10.64% from the fine-tune method.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedDreamer: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Latent Imagination on Complex EHRs for Clinical Decision Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19785v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly sampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on discretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and degrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical significance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how and when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for clinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in dynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment recommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data, making them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly generalizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose MedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment recommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data. Through latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to enhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined experiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal historical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular healthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV) treatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms both model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepRec: Towards a Deep Dive Into the Item Space with Large Language Model Based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16810v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been introduced into recommender systems (RSs), either to enhance traditional recommendation models (TRMs) or serve as recommendation backbones. However, existing LLM-based RSs often do not fully exploit the complementary advantages of LLMs (e.g., world knowledge and reasoning) and TRMs (e.g., recommendation-specific knowledge and efficiency) to fully explore the item space. To address this, we propose DeepRec, a novel LLM-based RS that enables autonomous multi-turn interactions between LLMs and TRMs for deep exploration of the item space. In each interaction turn, LLMs reason over user preferences and interact with TRMs to retrieve candidate items. After multi-turn interactions, LLMs rank the retrieved items to generate the final recommendations. We adopt reinforcement learning(RL) based optimization and propose novel designs from three aspects: recommendation model based data rollout, recommendation-oriented hierarchical rewards, and a two-stage RL training strategy. For data rollout, we introduce a preference-aware TRM, with which LLMs interact to construct trajectory data. For rewards, we design a hierarchical reward function that involves both process-level and outcome-level rewards to optimize the interaction process and recommendation performance, respectively. For RL training, we develop a two-stage training strategy, where the first stage aims to guide LLMs to interact with TRMs and the second stage focuses on performance improvement. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DeepRec significantly outperforms both traditional and LLM-based baselines, offering a new paradigm for deep exploration in recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correcting Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems via Item Loss Equalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04830v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RS) often suffer from popularity bias, where a small set of popular items dominate the recommendation results due to their high interaction rates, leaving many less popular items overlooked. This phenomenon disproportionately benefits users with mainstream tastes while neglecting those with niche interests, leading to unfairness among users and exacerbating disparities in recommendation quality across different user groups. In this paper, we propose an in-processing approach to address this issue by intervening in the training process of recommendation models. Drawing inspiration from fair empirical risk minimization in machine learning, we augment the objective function of the recommendation model with an additional term aimed at minimizing the disparity in loss values across different item groups during the training process. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and compared against state-of-the-art baselines. The results demonstrate the superior efficacy of our method in mitigating the unfairness of popularity bias while incurring only negligible loss in recommendation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Textual-Collaborative Gap through Semantic Codes for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12183v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, substantial research efforts have been devoted to enhancing sequential recommender systems by integrating abundant side information with ID-based collaborative information. This study specifically focuses on leveraging the textual metadata (e.g., titles and brands) associated with items. While existing methods have achieved notable success by combining text and ID representations, they often struggle to strike a balance between textual information embedded in text representations and collaborative information from sequential patterns of user behavior. In light of this, we propose CCFRec, a novel Code-based textual and Collaborative semantic Fusion method for sequential Recommendation. The key idea behind our approach is to bridge the gap between textual and collaborative information using semantic codes. Specifically, we generate fine-grained semantic codes from multi-view text embeddings through vector quantization techniques. Subsequently, we develop a code-guided semantic-fusion module based on the cross-attention mechanism to flexibly extract and integrate relevant information from text representations. In order to further enhance the fusion of textual and collaborative semantics, we introduce an optimization strategy that employs code masking with two specific objectives: masked code modeling and masked sequence alignment. The merit of these objectives lies in leveraging mask prediction tasks and augmented item representations to capture code correlations within individual items and enhance the sequence modeling of the recommendation backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of CCFRec, showing significant improvements over various sequential recommendation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CCFRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Diffusion Models in Sequential Recommendation: A Simple and Effective Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19544v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked issue of embedding collapse in existing diffusion-based sequential recommendation models and propose ADRec, an innovative framework designed to mitigate this problem. Diverging from previous diffusion-based methods, ADRec applies an independent noise process to each token and performs diffusion across the entire target sequence during training. ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across six datasets underscores the effectiveness of ADRec in enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion-based sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior Modeling on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19505v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in Recommendation Systems (RS) due to their extensive world knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities. However, a critical challenge lies in enabling LLMs to effectively comprehend and extract insights from massive user behaviors. Current approaches that directly leverage LLMs for user interest learning face limitations in handling long sequential behaviors, effectively extracting interest, and applying interest in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture diverse interests and interest evolution of user. CUBE divides user lifelong behaviors into multiple chunks and learns the interest and interest evolution within each chunk in a cascading manner. HTS generates candidate interests through hierarchical expansion and searches for the optimal interest with process rating model to ensure information gain for each behavior chunk. Additionally, we design Temporal-Ware Interest Fusion (TIF) to integrate interests from multiple behavior chunks, constructing a comprehensive representation of user lifelong interests. The representation can be embedded into any recommendation model to enhance performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Win Fast or Lose Slow: Balancing Speed and Accuracy in Latency-Sensitive Decisions of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19481v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse reasoning and generation tasks, and are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic environments such as code generation and recommendation systems. However, many real-world applications, such as high-frequency trading and real-time competitive gaming, require decisions under strict latency constraints, where faster responses directly translate into higher rewards. Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks. To support our investigation, we introduce two new benchmarks: HFTBench, a high frequency trading simulation, and StreetFighter, a competitive gaming platform. Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to 26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for LLM based agents. These results demonstrate the critical importance of latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for real world LLM based agents. Our benchmarks are available at Latency Sensitive Benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Recommendation Fairness without Sensitive Attributes Using Multi-Persona LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19473v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of recommender systems in alleviating information overload, fairness issues have raised concerns in recent years, potentially leading to unequal treatment for certain user groups. While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training. However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure. Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes. However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult. Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process. To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information. Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents. The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381v6)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream policy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream allocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and user retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream allocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which restricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial recommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the instruction-following and natural language generation capabilities of LLMs, our system effectively recommends music from diverse user queries while generating contextually relevant responses. While pretrained LLMs are primarily designed for text modality, TALKPLAY extends their scope through two key innovations: a multimodal music tokenizer that encodes audio features, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence signals; and a vocabulary expansion mechanism that enables unified processing and generation of both linguistic and music-relevant tokens. By integrating the recommendation system directly into the LLM architecture, TALKPLAY transforms conventional systems by: (1) unifying previous two-stage conversational recommendation systems (recommendation engines and dialogue managers) into a cohesive end-to-end system, (2) effectively utilizing long conversational context for recommendation while maintaining strong performance in extended multi-turn interactions, and (3) generating natural language responses for seamless user interaction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that TALKPLAY significantly outperforms unimodal approaches based solely on text or listening history in both recommendation performance and conversational naturalness.</p></details> |  |

Assessing fairness, though, is challenging due to constantly evolving metrics and best practices. This paper analyzes how industry practitioners perceive and incorporate these changing fairness standards in their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with 11 practitioners from technical teams across a range of large technology companies, we investigate industry implementations of fairness in recommendation system products. We focus on current debiasing practices, applied metrics, collaborative strategies, and integrating academic research into practice. Findings show a preference for multi-dimensional debiasing over traditional demographic methods, and a reliance on intuitive rather than academic metrics. This study also highlights the difficulties in balancing fairness with both the practitioner's individual (bottom-up) roles and organizational (top-down) workplace constraints, including the interplay with legal and compliance experts. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the recommender system community and algorithmic fairness practitioners, underlining the need to refine fairness practices continually.</p></details> |  |

Explicit interactions capture predefined relationships, such as inner products, but often suffer from data sparsity, while implicit interactions excel at learning complex patterns through non-linear transformations but lack inductive biases for efficient low-order modeling. Existing two-stream architectures integrate these paradigms but face challenges such as limited information sharing, gradient imbalance, and difficulty preserving low-order signals in sparse CTR data. We propose a novel framework, Dynamic Low-Order-Aware Fusion (DLF), which addresses these limitations through two key components: a Residual-Aware Low-Order Interaction Network (RLI) and a Network-Aware Attention Fusion Module (NAF). RLI explicitly preserves low-order signals while mitigating redundancy from residual connections, and NAF dynamically integrates explicit and implicit representations at each layer, enhancing information sharing and alleviating gradient imbalance. Together, these innovations balance low-order and high-order interactions, improving model expressiveness. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DLF achieves state-of-the-art performance in CTR prediction, addressing key limitations of existing models. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/DLF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR '25)</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Latent Reasoning for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19092v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods.

| **[Lightweight Embeddings with Graph Rewiring for Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18999v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As recommendation services scale rapidly and their deployment now commonly involves resource-constrained edge devices, GNN-based recommender systems face significant challenges, including high embedding storage costs and runtime latency from graph propagations. Our previous work, LEGCF, effectively reduced embedding storage costs but struggled to maintain recommendation performance under stricter storage limits. Additionally, LEGCF did not address the extensive runtime computation costs associated with graph propagation, which involves heavy multiplication and accumulation operations (MACs). These challenges consequently hinder effective training and inference on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose Lightweight Embeddings with Rewired Graph for Graph Collaborative Filtering (LERG), an improved extension of LEGCF. LERG retains LEGCFs compositional codebook structure but introduces quantization techniques to reduce the storage cost, enabling the inclusion of more meta-embeddings within the same storage. To optimize graph propagation, we pretrain the quantized compositional embedding table using the full interaction graph on resource-rich servers, after which a fine-tuning stage is engaged to identify and prune low-contribution entities via a gradient-free binary integer programming approach, constructing a rewired graph that excludes these entities (i.e., user/item nodes) from propagating signals. The quantized compositional embedding table with selective embedding participation and sparse rewired graph are transferred to edge devices which significantly reduce computation memory and inference time. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets, including an industry-scale dataset, demonstrate that LERG achieves superior recommendation performance while dramatically reducing storage and computation costs for graph-based recommendation services.</p></details> | Accepted by TOIS'25 |
| **[iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662v3)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2025 and WWW2025@HCRS</p></details> |

On online platforms, users have the opportunity to share feedback in various modes, including numerical ratings, textual reviews, and likes/dislikes. Traditional recommendation systems rely on users explicit ratings or implicit interactions (e.g. likes, clicks, shares, saves) to learn user preferences and item characteristics. Beyond these numerical ratings, textual reviews provide insights into users fine-grained preferences and item features. Analyzing these reviews is crucial for enhancing the performance and interpretability of personalized recommendation results. In recent years, review-based recommender systems have emerged as a significant sub-field in this domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in review-based recommender systems over recent years, highlighting the importance of reviews in recommender systems, as well as the challenges associated with extracting features from reviews and integrating them into ratings. Specifically, we present a categorization of these systems and summarize the state-of-the-art methods, analyzing their unique features, effectiveness, and limitations. Finally, we propose potential directions for future research, including the integration of multimodal data, multi-criteria rating information, and ethical considerations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, when combined with conventional recommendation models (CRMs), LLMs often face challenges related to high inference costs and static knowledge transfer methods. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters dynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based recommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods, LLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models, enhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with collaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise adaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates the need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec significantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks without increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in sequential recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, under review</p></details> |

As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Speculative Decoding for Fast Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20316v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD) methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face challenges in ranking systems due to their left-to-right decoding paradigm. Firstly, ranking systems require strict latency constraints, but verification rounds in SD methods remain agnostic; Secondly, SD methods usually discard listwise ranking knowledge about unaccepted items in previous rounds, hindering future multi-token prediction, especially when candidate tokens are the unaccepted items. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Speculative Decoding method for fast ranking inference of LLMs. To meet the ranking systems' latency requirement, we propose an up-to-down decoding paradigm that employs an agent to iteratively modify the ranking sequence under a constrained budget. Specifically, we design a ranking-tailored policy optimization, actively exploring optimal multi-round ranking modification policy verified by LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To better approximate the target LLM under the constrained budget, we trigger the agent fully utilizing the listwise ranking knowledge about all items verified by LLMs across different rounds in RL, enhancing the modification policy of the agent. More importantly, we demonstrate the theoretical robustness and advantages of our paradigm and implementation. Experiments on both IR and RS tasks show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 5 table</p></details> |
| **[LARES: Latent Reasoning for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16865v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommender systems have become increasingly important in real-world applications that model user behavior sequences to predict their preferences. However, existing sequential recommendation methods predominantly rely on non-reasoning paradigms, which may limit the model's computational capacity and result in suboptimal recommendation performance. To address these limitations, we present LARES, a novel and scalable LAtent REasoning framework for Sequential recommendation that enhances model's representation capabilities through increasing the computation density of parameters by depth-recurrent latent reasoning. Our proposed approach employs a recurrent architecture that allows flexible expansion of reasoning depth without increasing parameter complexity, thereby effectively capturing dynamic and intricate user interest patterns. A key difference of LARES lies in refining all input tokens at each implicit reasoning step to improve the computation utilization. To fully unlock the model's reasoning potential, we design a two-phase training strategy: (1) Self-supervised pre-training (SPT) with dual alignment objectives; (2) Reinforcement post-training (RPT). During the first phase, we introduce trajectory-level alignment and step-level alignment objectives, which enable the model to learn recommendation-oriented latent reasoning patterns without requiring supplementary annotated data. The subsequent phase utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to harness the model's exploratory ability, further refining its reasoning capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate our framework's superior performance. Notably, LARES exhibits seamless compatibility with existing advanced models, further improving their recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Generative Model with Causality Constraint for Mitigating Biases in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16708v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting counterfactual user feedback is essential for building effective recommender systems. However, latent confounding bias can obscure the true causal relationship between user feedback and item exposure, ultimately degrading recommendation performance. Existing causal debiasing approaches often rely on strong assumptions-such as the availability of instrumental variables (IVs) or strong correlations between latent confounders and proxy variables-that are rarely satisfied in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework called Latent Causality Constraints for Debiasing representation learning in Recommender Systems (LCDR). Specifically, LCDR leverages an identifiable Variational Autoencoder (iVAE) as a causal constraint to align the latent representations learned by a standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) through a unified loss function. This alignment allows the model to leverage even weak or noisy proxy variables to recover latent confounders effectively. The resulting representations are then used to improve recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LCDR consistently outperforms existing methods in both mitigating bias and improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MDVT: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendation with Model-Agnostic Multimodal-Driven Virtual Triplets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16665v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data sparsity problem significantly hinders the performance of recommender systems, as traditional models rely on limited historical interactions to learn user preferences and item properties. While incorporating multimodal information can explicitly represent these preferences and properties, existing works often use it only as side information, failing to fully leverage its potential. In this paper, we propose MDVT, a model-agnostic approach that constructs multimodal-driven virtual triplets to provide valuable supervision signals, effectively mitigating the data sparsity problem in multimodal recommendation systems. To ensure high-quality virtual triplets, we introduce three tailored warm-up threshold strategies: static, dynamic, and hybrid. The static warm-up threshold strategy exhaustively searches for the optimal number of warm-up epochs but is time-consuming and computationally intensive. The dynamic warm-up threshold strategy adjusts the warm-up period based on loss trends, improving efficiency but potentially missing optimal performance. The hybrid strategy combines both, using the dynamic strategy to find the approximate optimal number of warm-up epochs and then refining it with the static strategy in a narrow hyper-parameter space. Once the warm-up threshold is satisfied, the virtual triplets are used for joint model optimization by our enhanced pair-wise loss function without causing significant gradient skew. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating MDVT into advanced multimodal recommendation models effectively alleviates the data sparsity problem and improves recommendation performance, particularly in sparse data scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Breaking Information Cocoons: A Hyperbolic Graph-LLM Framework for Exploration and Exploitation in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13865v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern recommender systems often create information cocoons, restricting users' exposure to diverse content. A key challenge lies in balancing content exploration and exploitation while allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be modeled as a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical structures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical modeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to provide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To address these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework that effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a semantic-enhanced hierarchical mechanism that aligns rich textual descriptions processed by large language models (LLMs) with collaborative information directly in hyperbolic space, allowing for more nuanced updates that respect the underlying hierarchical structure in user-item profiles; (2) an automatic hierarchical representation by optimizing Dasgupta's cost, which discovers hierarchical structures without requiring predefined hyperparameters, enabling user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics, effectively mitigating information cocoons. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/Martin-qyma/HERec.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSM-VEC: A Large-Scale Disk-Based System for Dynamic Vector Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17152v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector search underpins modern AI applications by supporting approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries over high-dimensional embeddings in tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and multimodal search. Traditional ANN search indices (e.g., HNSW) are limited by memory constraints at large data scale. Disk-based indices such as DiskANN reduce memory overhead but rely on offline graph construction, resulting in costly and inefficient vector updates. The state-of-the-art clustering-based approach SPFresh offers better scalability but suffers from reduced recall due to coarse partitioning. Moreover, SPFresh employs in-place updates to maintain its index structure, limiting its efficiency in handling high-throughput insertions and deletions under dynamic workloads. This paper presents LSM-VEC, a disk-based dynamic vector index that integrates hierarchical graph indexing with LSM-tree storage. By distributing the proximity graph across multiple LSM-tree levels, LSM-VEC supports out-of-place vector updates. It enhances search efficiency via a sampling-based probabilistic search strategy with adaptive neighbor selection, and connectivity-aware graph reordering further reduces I/O without requiring global reconstruction. Experiments on billion-scale datasets demonstrate that LSM-VEC consistently outperforms existing disk-based ANN systems. It achieves higher recall, lower query and update latency, and reduces memory footprint by over 66.2%, making it well-suited for real-world large-scale vector search with dynamic updates.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Accelerating Maximal Biclique Enumeration on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05039v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximal Biclique Enumeration (MBE) holds critical importance in graph theory with applications extending across fields such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. However, its computational complexity presents barriers for efficiently scaling to large graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce cuMBE, a GPU-optimized parallel algorithm for MBE. Utilizing a unique data structure, called compact array, cuMBE eradicates the need for recursion, thereby significantly minimizing dynamic memory requirements and computational overhead. The algorithm utilizes a hybrid parallelism approach, in which GPU thread blocks handle coarse-grained tasks associated with part of the search process. Besides, we implement three fine-grained optimizations within each thread block to enhance performance. Further, we integrate a work-stealing mechanism to mitigate workload imbalances among thread blocks. Our experiments reveal that cuMBE achieves an geometric mean speedup of 4.02x and 4.13x compared to the state-of-the-art serial algorithm and parallel CPU-based algorithm on both common and real-world datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conf-GNNRec: Quantifying and Calibrating the Prediction Confidence for GNN-based Recommendation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16466v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically, we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction confidence and recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static Testbeds: An Interaction-Centric Agent Simulation Platform for Dynamic Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16429v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Search and Recommendation: A Generative Paradigm Inspired by Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process. To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective.</p></details> |  |

This raises key questions: Do LLMs behave rationally? How do they perform compared to humans? Do they tend to reach an efficient and fair outcome? What is the role of natural language in strategic interaction? How do characteristics of the economic environment influence these dynamics? These questions become crucial concerning the economic and societal implications of integrating LLM-based agents into real-world data-driven systems, such as online retail platforms and recommender systems. To answer these questions, we introduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential, language-based games. Inspired by the economic literature, we define three base families of games with consistent parameterization, degrees of freedom and economic measures to evaluate agents' performance (self-gain), as well as the game outcome (efficiency and fairness). We develop an open-source framework for interaction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM vs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional dataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the behavior of LLM-based agents in various economic contexts; (ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures; and (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the environments on the behavior of agents. Our results suggest that the market parameters, as well as the choice of the LLMs, tend to have complex and interdependent effects on the economic outcome, which calls for careful design and analysis of the language-based economic ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explain What You Mean: Intent Augmented Knowledge Graph Recommender Built With An LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interaction sparsity is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems. Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It is also found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue either enrich the connectivity data by incorporating social networks or external knowledge graphs, or fine-tune LLMs into interaction augmenters or next-item recommenders. However, these techniques tend to be resource demanding, requiring high computational power. They also have several limitations, including data availability, low quality, or synthetic noise issues. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR leverages latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Is Serendipity? An Interview Study to Conceptualize Experienced Serendipity in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15440v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serendipity has been associated with numerous benefits in the context of recommender systems, e.g., increased user satisfaction and consumption of long-tail items. Despite this, serendipity in the context of recommender systems has thus far remained conceptually ambiguous. This conceptual ambiguity has led to inconsistent operationalizations between studies, making it difficult to compare and synthesize findings. In this paper, we conceptualize the user's experience of serendipity. To this effect, we interviewed 17 participants and analyzed the data following the grounded theory paradigm. Based on these interviews, we conceptualize experienced serendipity as "a user experience in which a user unintentionally encounters content that feels fortuitous, refreshing, and enriching". We find that all three components -- fortuitous, refreshing and enriching -- are necessary and together are sufficient to classify a user's experience as serendipitous. However, these components can be satisfied through a variety of conditions. Our conceptualization unifies previous definitions of serendipity within a single framework, resolving inconsistencies by identifying distinct flavors of serendipity. It highlights underexposed flavors, offering new insights into how users experience serendipity in the context of recommender systems. By clarifying the components and conditions of experienced serendipity in recommender systems, this work can guide the design of recommender systems that stimulate experienced serendipity in their users, and lays the groundwork for developing a standardized operationalization of experienced serendipity in its many flavors, enabling more consistent and comparable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 tables, to be published in "Proceedings of the 33rd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization"</p></details> |

SDD extends continuous state-space diffusion models with an explicit representation of exact zeros by modeling sparsity through the introduction of Sparsity Bits. Empirical validation in various domains, including two scientific applications in physics and biology, demonstrates that SDD achieves high fidelity in representing data sparsity while preserving the quality of the generated data.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data.

In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors.

Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and benchmark datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/mohbattharani/KERL.</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2025 |

However, these methods are still trained on all the data available, requiring multiple days to train a single model, without counting hyperparameter tuning. In this work we focus on graph-based recommender systems, i.e., systems that model the data as a heterogeneous network. In other applications, graph sampling allows to study a subgraph and generalize the findings to the original graph. Thus, we investigate the applicability of sampling techniques for this task. We test on three real world datasets, with three state-of-the-art inductive methods, and using six different sampling methods. We find that its possible to maintain performance using only 50% of the training data with up to 86% percent decrease in training time; however, using less training data leads to far worse performance. Further, we find that when it comes to data for recommendations, graph sampling should also account for the temporal dimension. Therefore, we find that if higher data reduction is needed, new graph based sampling techniques should be studied and new inductive methods should be designed.</p></details> |  |

This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret in terms of $\Delta$.</p></details> | 38 pages |

In recent years, the integration of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm. Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods.

For example, in recommender systems, one is interested in selecting relevant items, while providing a diversified recommendation. Constrained subset selection problem is NP-hard, and popular approaches such as Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) are based on greedy selection. Many real-world applications involve large data, but the original MMR work did not consider distributed selection. This limitation was later addressed by a method called DGDS which allows for a distributed setting using random data partitioning. Here, we exploit structure in the data to further improve both scalability and performance on the target application. We propose MUSS, a novel method that uses a multilevel approach to relevant and diverse selection. In a recommender system application, our method can not only improve the performance up to $4$ percent points in precision, but is also $20$ to $80$ times faster. Our method is also capable of outperforming baselines on RAG-based question answering accuracy. We present a novel theoretical approach for analyzing this type of problems, and show that our method achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal objective. Moreover, our analysis also resulted in a $\times 2$ tighter bound for DGDS compared to previously known bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>model...</summary><p>model in production at Amazon</p></details> |

Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal) LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic tag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF presents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the extracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We conduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and public datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically show that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than the modeling of item topics. Additionally, we provide evidence that the extracted logic graphs are empirically a general and transferable knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Dirichlet Energy Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13892v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommender systems have achieved remarkable effectiveness by modeling high-order interactions between users and items. However, such approaches are significantly undermined by popularity bias, which distorts the interaction graph's structure, referred to as topology bias. This leads to overrepresentation of popular items, thereby reinforcing biases and fairness issues through the user-system feedback loop. Despite attempts to study this effect, most prior work focuses on the embedding or gradient level bias, overlooking how topology bias fundamentally distorts the message passing process itself. We bridge this gap by providing an empirical and theoretical analysis from a Dirichlet energy perspective, revealing that graph message passing inherently amplifies topology bias and consistently benefits highly connected nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Test-time Simplicial Propagation (TSP), which extends message passing to higher-order simplicial complexes. By incorporating richer structures beyond pairwise connections, TSP mitigates harmful topology bias and substantially improves the representation and recommendation of long-tail items during inference. Extensive experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in mitigating topology bias and enhancing recommendation quality.</p></details> |  |

However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform), to serve the major online traffic. Codes will be released after this paper is published.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper, accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

In humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear. We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments; and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems.

We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can function as universal retrievers, capable of handling multiple objectives within a generative retrieval framework. To model complex user-item relationships within generative retrieval, we propose multi-query representation. To address the challenge of extremely large candidate sets in industrial recommender systems, we introduce matrix decomposition to boost model learnability, discriminability, and transferability, and we incorporate probabilistic sampling to reduce computation costs. Finally, our Universal Retrieval Model (URM) can adaptively generate a set from tens of millions of candidates based on arbitrary given objective while keeping the latency within tens of milliseconds. Applied to industrial-scale data, URM outperforms expert models elaborately designed for different retrieval objectives on offline experiments and significantly improves the core metric of online advertising platform by $3\%$.</p></details> |  |

As the demand for high-quality and large-scale data continues to rise, data copyright protection is attracting increasing attention. In this work, we explore the problem of data watermarking for sequential recommender systems, where a watermark is embedded into the target dataset and can be detected in models trained on that dataset. We focus on two settings: dataset watermarking, which protects the ownership of the entire dataset, and user watermarking, which safeguards the data of individual users. We present a method named Dataset Watermarking for Recommender Systems (DWRS) to address them. We define the watermark as a sequence of consecutive items inserted into normal users' interaction sequences. We define a Receptive Field (RF) to guide the inserting process to facilitate the memorization of the watermark. Extensive experiments on five representative sequential recommendation models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DWRS in protecting data copyright while preserving model utility.</p></details> |  |

A typical FedRec involves transmitting the full model and entire weight updates between edge devices and the server, causing significant burdens to devices with limited bandwidth and computational power. While the sparsity of embedding updates provides opportunity for payload optimization, existing sparsity-aware federated protocols generally sacrifice privacy for efficiency. A key challenge in designing a secure sparsity-aware efficient protocol is to protect the rated item indices from the server. In this paper, we propose a lossless secure recommender systems on sparse embedding updates (SecEmb). SecEmb reduces user payload while ensuring that the server learns no information about both rated item indices and individual updates except the aggregated model. The protocol consists of two correlated modules: (1) a privacy-preserving embedding retrieval module that allows users to download relevant embeddings from the server, and (2) an update aggregation module that securely aggregates updates at the server. Empirical analysis demonstrates that SecEmb reduces both download and upload communication costs by up to 90x and decreases user-side computation time by up to 70x compared with secure FedRec protocols. Additionally, it offers non-negligible utility advantages compared with lossy message compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose FedMR, a novel multimodal FedRec framework centered around the Mixing Feature Fusion Module (MFFM). FedMR employs a two-stage process: (1) Server-side centralized multimedia content processing provides rich, shared item context using pre-trained models, mitigating limitations from client sparsity and resource constraints efficiently. (2) Client-Side Personalized Refinement, where the MFFM dynamically adapts these server-provided multimodal representations based on client-specific interaction patterns, effectively tailoring recommendations and resolving heterogeneity in user preferences towards different modalities. Extensive experiments validate that FedMR seamlessly enhances existing ID-based FedRecs, effectively transforming them into high-performing federated multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables, conference</p></details> |

Traditional attack strategies often rely on simplistic heuristics, require access to internal RS data, and overlook the manipulation potential of textual reviews. In this work, we introduce Agent4SR, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to perform low-knowledge, high-impact shilling attacks through both rating and review generation. Agent4SR simulates realistic user behavior by orchestrating adversarial interactions, selecting items, assigning ratings, and crafting reviews, while maintaining behavioral plausibility. Our design includes targeted profile construction, hybrid memory retrieval, and a review attack strategy that propagates target item features across unrelated reviews to amplify manipulation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and RS architectures demonstrate that Agent4SR outperforms existing low-knowledge baselines in both effectiveness and stealth. Our findings reveal a new class of emergent threats posed by LLM-driven agents, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced defenses in modern recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, under review</p></details> |

However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch-time prediction and user engagement modeling. Specifically, deploying CQE online on a large-scale platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users has led to substantial gains in key evaluation metrics, including active days, engagement time, and video views. These results highlight the practical impact of our proposed approach in enhancing the user experience and overall performance of the short video recommendation system.

Traditional recommender systems have made significant strides in this direction, but they often lack the ability to tap into the richness of conversational data. This paper represents a novel approach to recommendation systems by integrating conversational insights into the recommendation process. The Conversational Recommender System integrates cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, leveraging machine learning algorithms like Apriori for Association Rule Mining, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Furthermore, sophisticated voice recognition technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms, play a crucial role in accurate speech-to-text conversion, ensuring robust performance in diverse environments. The methodology incorporates a fusion of content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches, enhancing them with NLP techniques.

Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To clarify what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves' are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases, and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring, policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns, and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated discrimination.</p></details> |  |

However, as embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale recommenders.

| **[On the Role of Weight Decay in Collaborative Filtering: A Popularity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11318v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors. Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity. Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies. Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength, offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

Customer utterances are characterized by infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity. Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem, we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings. Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new customer intents in dynamic domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Generation of Preference Data for Recommendation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating a recommendation system in a controlled environment, to identify specific behaviors and user preferences, requires highly flexible synthetic data generation models capable of mimicking the patterns and trends of real datasets. In this context, we propose HYDRA, a novel preferences data generation model driven by three main factors: user-item interaction level, item popularity, and user engagement level. The key innovations of the proposed process include the ability to generate user communities characterized by similar item adoptions, reflecting real-world social influences and trends. Additionally, HYDRA considers item popularity and user engagement as mixtures of different probability distributions, allowing for a more realistic simulation of diverse scenarios. This approach enhances the model's capacity to simulate a wide range of real-world cases, capturing the complexity and variability found in actual user behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HYDRA through extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets. The results highlight its capability to replicate real-world data patterns, offering valuable insights for developing and testing recommendation systems in a controlled and realistic manner. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/SimoneMungari/HYDRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Item-Language Model for Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02844v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language Models (LLMs) have been extremely successful at tasks like complex dialogue understanding, reasoning and coding due to their emergent abilities. These emergent abilities have been extended with multi-modality to include image, audio, and video capabilities. Recommender systems, on the other hand, have been critical for information seeking and item discovery needs. Recently, there have been attempts to apply LLMs for recommendations. One difficulty of current attempts is that the underlying LLM is usually not trained on the recommender system data, which largely contains user interaction signals and is often not publicly available. Another difficulty is user interaction signals often have a different pattern from natural language text, and it is currently unclear if the LLM training setup can learn more non-trivial knowledge from interaction signals compared with traditional recommender system methods. Finally, it is difficult to train multiple LLMs for different use-cases, and to retain the original language and reasoning abilities when learning from recommender system data. To address these three limitations, we propose an Item-Language Model (ILM), which is composed of an item encoder to produce text-aligned item representations that encode user interaction signals, and a frozen LLM that can understand those item representations with preserved pretrained knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate both the importance of the language-alignment and of user interaction knowledge in the item encoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

By integrating Processing-In-Memory~(PIM) architectures, researchers can reduce data movement and enhance energy efficiency, paving the way for next-generation recommender models. Nevertheless, achieving performance and efficiency gains is challenging due to the complexity of the PIM design space and the intricate mapping of operators. In this paper, we demonstrate that automated PIM design is feasible even within the most demanding recommender model design space, spanning over $10^{54}$ possible architectures. We propose \methodname, which formulates the co-optimization of recommender models and PIM design as a combinatorial search over mixed-precision interaction operations, and parameterizes the search with a one-shot supernet encompassing all mixed-precision options. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on three Click-Through Rate benchmarks, showcasing the superiority of our automated design methodology over manual approaches. Our results indicate up to a 3.36$\times$ speedup, 1.68$\times$ area reduction, and 12.48$\times$ higher power efficiency compared to naively mapped searched designs and state-of-the-art handcrafted designs.</p></details> | GLSVLSI 2025 |

However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Approximate Biclique Counting over Large Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10471v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPRec: Temporal-Aware Graph Spectral Filtering for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11552v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain. GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Memorize Recommendation Datasets? A Preliminary Study on MovieLens-1M](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have made all the code publicly available at: https://github.com/sisinflab/LLM-MemoryInspector</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards More Efficient, Robust, Instance-adaptive, and Generalizable Sequential Decision making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09192v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |
| **[How Students Use AI Feedback Matters: Experimental Evidence on Physics Achievement and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08672v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the precision and adaptiveness of generative AI (GAI)-powered feedback provided to students, existing practice and literature might ignore how usage patterns impact student learning. This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p < 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p < 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p < 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p < 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p < 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p < 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shallow AutoEncoding Recommender with Cold Start Handling via Side Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02288v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User and item cold starts present significant challenges in industrial applications of recommendation systems. Supplementing user-item interaction data with metadata is a common solution-but often at the cost of introducing additional biases. In this work, we introduce an augmented EASE model that seamlessly integrates both user and item side information to address these cold start issues. Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method produces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold items while refining user representations in data-sparse environments. Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong baseline for future comparative studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing submission to CIKM 2025; 2 Figures; 4 Tables; 13 pages; Python code implementation example</p></details> |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning for Multi-Objective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08911v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify "high" achievable goals for inference. While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Models in Multimodal Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09777v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Adaptively-weighted Nearest Neighbors for Matrix Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09612v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical note, we introduce and analyze AWNN: an adaptively weighted nearest neighbor method for performing matrix completion. Nearest neighbor (NN) methods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines such as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in panel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very intuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees. However, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate choice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest neighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past two decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii and the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN addresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off inherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the theory via synthetic experiments.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing datasets predominantly focus on Western songs with mood terms derived from English, which may limit generalizability across diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. To address this, we introduce `GlobalMood', a novel cross-cultural benchmark dataset comprising 1,180 songs sampled from 59 countries, with large-scale annotations collected from 2,519 individuals across five culturally and linguistically distinct locations: U.S., France, Mexico, S. Korea, and Egypt. Rather than imposing predefined mood categories, we implement a bottom-up, participant-driven approach to organically elicit culturally specific music-related mood terms. We then recruit another pool of human participants to collect 988,925 ratings for these culture-specific descriptors. Our analysis confirms the presence of a valence-arousal structure shared across cultures, yet also reveals significant divergences in how certain mood terms, despite being dictionary equivalents, are perceived cross-culturally. State-of-the-art multimodal models benefit substantially from fine-tuning on our cross-culturally balanced dataset, as evidenced by improved alignment with human evaluations - particularly in non-English contexts. More broadly, our findings inform the ongoing debate on the universality versus cultural specificity of emotional descriptors, and our methodology can contribute to other multimodal and cross-lingual research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Debate-to-Detect: Reformulating Misinformation Detection as a Real-World Debate with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18596v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.</p></details> |  |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

As such, interpreting misleading creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Moderation and the New Epistemology of Fact Checking on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20067v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale.</p></details> | 1 Figure, 2 tables |
| **[T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19768v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Detection: A Multimodal Multi-Task Dataset for Benchmarking Health Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18685v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI, capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation, resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics, most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks (reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection) demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios, facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal levels.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Detecting Fake News Belief via Skin and Blood Flow Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16730v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses significant risks to public opinion, health, and security. While most fake news detection methods rely on text analysis, little is known about how people physically respond to false information or repeated exposure to the same statements. This study investigates whether wearable sensors can detect belief in a statement or prior exposure to it. We conducted a controlled experiment where participants evaluated statements while wearing an EmotiBit sensor that measured their skin conductance (electrodermal activity, EDA) and peripheral blood flow (photoplethysmography, PPG). From 28 participants, we collected a dataset of 672 trials, each labeled with whether the participant believed the statement and whether they had seen it before. This dataset introduces a new resource for studying physiological responses to misinformation. Using machine learning models, including KNN, CNN, and LightGBM, we analyzed these physiological patterns. The best-performing model achieved 67.83\% accuracy, with skin conductance outperforming PPG. These findings demonstrate the potential of wearable sensors as a minimally intrusive tool for detecting belief and prior exposure, offering new directions for real-time misinformation detection and adaptive, user-aware systems.</p></details> | Research Report |
| **[Truth and Trust: Fake News Detection via Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16702v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individuals physiologically respond to false information is crucial for advancing misinformation detection systems. This study explores the potential of using physiological signals, specifically electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG), to classify both the veracity of information and its interaction with user belief. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we collected EDA and PPG signals while participants evaluated the truthfulness of climate-related claims. Each trial was labeled based on the objective truth of the claim and the participant's belief, enabling two classification tasks: binary veracity detection and a novel four-class joint belief-veracity classification. We extracted handcrafted features from the raw signals and trained several machine learning models to benchmark the dataset. Our results show that EDA outperforms PPG, indicating its greater sensitivity to physiological responses related to truth perception. However, performance significantly drops in the joint belief-veracity classification task, highlighting the complexity of modeling the interaction between belief and truth. These findings suggest that while physiological signals can reflect basic truth perception, accurately modeling the intricate relationships between belief and veracity remains a significant challenge. This study emphasizes the importance of multimodal approaches that incorporate psychological, physiological, and cognitive factors to improve fake news detection systems. Our work provides a foundation for future research aimed at enhancing misinformation detection via addressing the complexities of human belief and truth processing.</p></details> | Research report |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |
| **[CAMOUFLAGE: Exploiting Misinformation Detection Systems Through LLM-driven Adversarial Claim Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01900v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evidence-based misinformation detection systems, which evaluate the veracity of short claims against evidence, lack comprehensive analysis of their adversarial vulnerabilities. Existing black-box text-based adversarial attacks are ill-suited for evidence-based misinformation detection systems, as these attacks primarily focus on token-level substitutions involving gradient or logit-based optimization strategies, which are incapable of fooling the multi-component nature of these detection systems. These systems incorporate both retrieval and claim-evidence comparison modules, which requires attacks to break the retrieval of evidence and/or the comparison module so that it draws incorrect inferences. We present CAMOUFLAGE, an iterative, LLM-driven approach that employs a two-agent system, a Prompt Optimization Agent and an Attacker Agent, to create adversarial claim rewritings that manipulate evidence retrieval and mislead claim-evidence comparison, effectively bypassing the system without altering the meaning of the claim. The Attacker Agent produces semantically equivalent rewrites that attempt to mislead detectors, while the Prompt Optimization Agent analyzes failed attack attempts and refines the prompt of the Attacker to guide subsequent rewrites. This enables larger structural and stylistic transformations of the text rather than token-level substitutions, adapting the magnitude of changes based on previous outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, CAMOUFLAGE optimizes its attack solely based on binary model decisions to guide its rewriting process, eliminating the need for classifier logits or extensive querying. We evaluate CAMOUFLAGE on four systems, including two recent academic systems and two real-world APIs, with an average attack success rate of 46.92\% while preserving textual coherence and semantic equivalence to the original claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Misinformation Detection by Visiting Potential Commonsense Conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21604v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Internet technology has led to an increased prevalence of misinformation, causing severe negative effects across diverse domains. To mitigate this challenge, Misinformation Detection (MD), aiming to detect online misinformation automatically, emerges as a rapidly growing research topic in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play augmentation method for the MD task, namely Misinformation Detection with Potential Commonsense Conflict (MD-PCC). We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis. Empirical results demonstrate that MD-PCC can consistently outperform the existing MD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. Accepted by IJCAI 2025.

| **[A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060v3)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Cognition and Emotion: Empathy-Driven Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17332v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the digital era, social media has become a major conduit for information dissemination, yet it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation. Traditional misinformation detection methods primarily focus on surface-level features, overlooking the crucial roles of human empathy in the propagation process. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Aspect Empathy Framework (DAE), which integrates cognitive and emotional empathy to analyze misinformation from both the creator and reader perspectives. By examining creators' cognitive strategies and emotional appeals, as well as simulating readers' cognitive judgments and emotional responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), DAE offers a more comprehensive and human-centric approach to misinformation detection. Moreover, we further introduce an empathy-aware filtering mechanism to enhance response authenticity and diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE outperforms existing methods, providing a novel paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, we propose a voice-based, interactive learning companion designed to amplify and extend cognitive abilities through informal learning. Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection. Early qualitative feedback suggests that Factually can enhance users' fact-checking capabilities, offering both practical and experiential benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING</p></details> |

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Latent Multimodal Reconstruction for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06010v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on creating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD). Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated MMD datasets, recent studies leverage synthetic training data via out-of-context image-caption pairs or named entity manipulations; altering names, dates, and locations. However, these approaches often produce simplistic misinformation that fails to reflect real-world complexity, limiting the robustness of detection models trained on them. Meanwhile, despite recent advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain underutilized for generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data for MMD. To address this gap, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a training dataset comprising LVLM-generated miscaptioned images. Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to the detection process. To optimize LAMAR, we explore different training strategies (end-to-end training and large-scale pre-training) and integration approaches (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" generalize better on real-world misinformation, while LAMAR sets new state-of-the-art on both NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks; highlighting the potential of LVLM-generated data and reconstruction-based approaches for advancing MMD. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/miscaptioned-image-reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework with Automated Decision Rule Optimization for Cross-Domain Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23329v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spans various domains, but detection methods trained on specific domains often perform poorly when applied to others. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to utilize LLMs for cross-domain misinformation detection. However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to adequately analyze news in the target domain, limiting their detection capabilities. More importantly, these methods typically rely on manually designed decision rules, which are limited by domain knowledge and expert experience, thus limiting the generalizability of decision rules to different domains. To address these issues, we propose a MultiAgent Framework for cross-domain misinformation detection with Automated Decision Rule Optimization (MARO). Under this framework, we first employs multiple expert agents to analyze target-domain news. Subsequently, we introduce a question-reflection mechanism that guides expert agents to facilitate higherquality analysis. Furthermore, we propose a decision rule optimization approach based on carefully-designed cross-domain validation tasks to iteratively enhance the effectiveness of decision rules in different domains. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on commonlyused datasets demonstrate that MARO achieves significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Most approaches to misinformation detection are monolingual, focused on high-resource languages, i.e., a handful of world languages that have benefited from substantial research investment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on misinformation detection in low-resource languages, both in monolingual and multilingual settings. We review existing datasets, methodologies, and tools used in these domains, identifying key challenges related to: data resources, model development, cultural and linguistic context, and real-world applications. We examine emerging approaches, such as language-generalizable models and multi-modal techniques, and emphasize the need for improved data collection practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stronger incentives for socially responsible AI research. Our findings underscore the importance of systems capable of addressing misinformation across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Framework for Misinformation Identification via Critical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14626v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language misinformation detection approaches have been, to date, largely dependent on sequence classification methods, producing opaque systems in which the reasons behind classification as misinformation are unclear. While an effort has been made in the area of automated fact-checking to propose explainable approaches to the problem, this is not the case for automated reason-checking systems. In this paper, we propose a new explainable framework for both factual and rational misinformation detection based on the theory of Argumentation Schemes and Critical Questions. For that purpose, we create and release NLAS-CQ, the first corpus combining 3,566 textbook-like natural language argumentation scheme instances and 4,687 corresponding answers to critical questions related to these arguments. On the basis of this corpus, we implement and validate our new framework which combines classification with question answering to analyse arguments in search of misinformation, and provides the explanations in form of critical questions to the human user.</p></details> |  |

One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unmasking Digital Falsehoods: A Comparative Analysis of LLM-Based Misinformation Detection Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00724v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXCLAIM: An Explainable Cross-Modal Agentic System for Misinformation Detection with Hierarchical Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06269v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation continues to pose a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem, profoundly shaping public perception and behavior. Among its various manifestations, Out-of-Context (OOC) misinformation is particularly obscure, as it distorts meaning by pairing authentic images with misleading textual narratives. Existing methods for detecting OOC misinformation predominantly rely on coarse-grained similarity metrics between image-text pairs, which often fail to capture subtle inconsistencies or provide meaningful explainability. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation, they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to address complex, fine-grained, and cross-modal distinctions necessary for robust OOC detection. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EXCLAIM, a retrieval-based framework designed to leverage external knowledge through multi-granularity index of multi-modal events and entities. Our approach integrates multi-granularity contextual analysis with a multi-agent reasoning architecture to systematically evaluate the consistency and integrity of multi-modal news content. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and resilience of EXCLAIM, demonstrating its ability to detect OOC misinformation with 4.3% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while offering explainable and actionable insights.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 17th ACM Web Science Conference 2025</p></details> |

This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Despite their success, the textual evidence of authentic images retrieved from the inverse search is directly transmitted to LVLMs, leading to inaccurate or false information in the decision-making phase. To this end, we present E2LVLM, a novel evidence-enhanced large vision-language model by adapting textual evidence in two levels. First, motivated by the fact that textual evidence provided by external tools struggles to align with LVLMs inputs, we devise a reranking and rewriting strategy for generating coherent and contextually attuned content, thereby driving the aligned and effective behavior of LVLMs pertinent to authentic images. Second, to address the scarcity of news domain datasets with both judgment and explanation, we generate a novel OOC multimodal instruction-following dataset by prompting LVLMs with informative content to acquire plausible explanations. Further, we develop a multimodal instruction-tuning strategy with convincing explanations for beyond detection. This scheme contributes to E2LVLM for multimodal OOC misinformation detection and explanation. A multitude of experiments demonstrate that E2LVLM achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art methods, and also provides compelling rationales for judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

Existing AI-driven detection systems lack explainability and require expensive finetuning. We address these issues with LLM-Consensus, a multi-agent debate system for OOC misinformation detection. LLM-Consensus introduces a novel multi-agent debate framework where multimodal agents collaborate to assess contextual consistency and request external information to enhance cross-context reasoning and decision-making. Our framework enables explainable detection with state-of-the-art accuracy even without domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive ablation studies confirm that external retrieval significantly improves detection accuracy, and user studies demonstrate that LLM-Consensus boosts performance for both experts and non-experts. These results position LLM-Consensus as a powerful tool for autonomous and citizen intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Machine Learning for Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12215v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating GenAI-powered Evidence Pollution for Out-of-Context Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14728v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have achieved significant success, they also raise growing concerns about online information security due to their potential misuse for generating deceptive content. Out-of-context (OOC) multimodal misinformation detection, which often retrieves Web evidence to identify the repurposing of images in false contexts, faces the issue of reasoning over GenAI-polluted evidence to derive accurate predictions. Existing works simulate GenAI-powered pollution at the claim level with stylistic rewriting to conceal linguistic cues, and ignore evidence-level pollution for such information-seeking applications. In this work, we investigate how polluted evidence affects the performance of existing OOC detectors, revealing a performance degradation of more than 9 percentage points. We propose two strategies, cross-modal evidence reranking and cross-modal claim-evidence reasoning, to address the challenges posed by polluted evidence. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that these strategies can effectively enhance the robustness of existing out-of-context detectors amidst polluted evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on eight misinformation detection datasets show that LLM-based detectors can achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Our experiments further demonstrate that LLMs exhibit great potential to enhance existing misinformation detection models. These findings highlight the potential ability of LLMs to detect misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Text Representations for Online Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18618v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mis- and disinformation, commonly collectively called fake news, continue to menace society. Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters Thesis, 106 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science.

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLING2025</p></details> |

| **[Verifying the Robustness of Automatic Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08032v3)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification methods have been widely investigated as a way to detect content of low credibility: fake news, social media bots, propaganda, etc. Quite accurate models (likely based on deep neural networks) help in moderating public electronic platforms and often cause content creators to face rejection of their submissions or removal of already published texts. Having the incentive to evade further detection, content creators try to come up with a slightly modified version of the text (known as an attack with an adversarial example) that exploit the weaknesses of classifiers and result in a different output. Here we systematically test the robustness of common text classifiers against available attacking techniques and discover that, indeed, meaning-preserving changes in input text can mislead the models. The approaches we test focus on finding vulnerable spans in text and replacing individual characters or words, taking into account the similarity between the original and replacement content. We also introduce BODEGA: a benchmark for testing both victim models and attack methods on four misinformation detection tasks in an evaluation framework designed to simulate real use-cases of content moderation. The attacked tasks include (1) fact checking and detection of (2) hyperpartisan news, (3) propaganda and (4) rumours. Our experimental results show that modern large language models are often more vulnerable to attacks than previous, smaller solutions, e.g. attacks on GEMMA being up to 27\% more successful than those on BERT. Finally, we manually analyse a subset adversarial examples and check what kinds of modifications are used in successful attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on the Role of Crowds in Combating Online Misinformation: Annotators, Evaluators, and Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02095v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online misinformation poses a global risk with significant real-world consequences. To combat misinformation, current research relies on professionals like journalists and fact-checkers for annotating and debunking misinformation, and develops automated machine learning methods for detecting misinformation. Complementary to these approaches, recent research has increasingly concentrated on utilizing the power of ordinary social media users, a.k.a. "crowd", who act as eyes-on-the-ground proactively questioning and countering misinformation. Notably, recent studies show that 96% of counter-misinformation responses originate from them. Acknowledging their prominent role, we present the first systematic and comprehensive survey of research papers that actively leverage the crowds to combat misinformation. We first identify 88 papers related to crowd-based efforts, following a meticulous annotation process adhering to the PRISMA framework. We then present key statistics related to misinformation, counter-misinformation, and crowd input in different formats and topics. Upon holistic analysis of the papers, we introduce a novel taxonomy of the roles played by the crowds: (i)annotators who actively identify misinformation; (ii)evaluators who assess counter-misinformation effectiveness; (iii)creators who create counter-misinformation. This taxonomy explores the crowd's capabilities in misinformation detection, identifies prerequisites for effective counter-misinformation, and analyzes crowd-generated counter-misinformation. Then, we delve into (i)distinguishing individual, collaborative, and machine-assisted labeling for annotators; (ii)analyzing the effectiveness of counter-misinformation through surveys, interviews, and in-lab experiments for evaluators; and (iii)characterizing creation patterns and creator profiles for creators. Finally, we outline potential future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey is accepted by ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (ACM TKDD) Journal.

We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, e.g. text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure until the victim classifier changes its decision. The evaluation confirms the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrediRAG: Network-Augmented Credibility-Based Retrieval for Misinformation Detection in Reddit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12061v2)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e., training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019 (3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public attention monitoring. Overall, we lay a strong foundation for multilingual epidemic preparedness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Despite growing interest in the research community in multi-modal misinformation detection, existing methods exhibit limitations in capturing semantic cues, key regions, and cross-modal similarities within multi-modal datasets. We propose SceneGraMMi, a Scene Graph-boosted Hybrid-fusion approach for Multi-modal Misinformation veracity prediction, which integrates scene graphs across different modalities to improve detection performance. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets show that SceneGraMMi consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In a comprehensive ablation study, we highlight the contribution of each component, while Shapley values are employed to examine the explainability of the model's decision-making process.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 mai...</summary><p>1 main figure, 8 tables, 10 pages, 12 figures in Appendix, 7 tables in Appendix GitHub URL: https://github.com/ComplexData-MILA/webretrieval</p></details> |

The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision & ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 tables presented at the OASIS workshop of the ACM Hypertext and Social Media Conference 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches for this task assume the availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain expertise. In contrast, since obtaining a large corpus of unlabeled image-text pairs is much easier, here, we propose a semi-supervised protocol, where the model has access to a limited number of labeled image-text pairs and a large corpus of unlabeled pairs. Additionally, the occurrence of fake news being much lesser compared to the real ones, the datasets tend to be highly imbalanced, thus making the task even more challenging. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework, Consensus from Vision-Language Models (CoVLM), which generates robust pseudo-labels for unlabeled pairs using thresholds derived from the labeled data. This approach can automatically determine the right threshold parameters of the model for selecting the confident pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets across challenging conditions and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on assessing veracity, overlooking the legal implications and social consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset curation approach that utilizes crowd-sourced checkworthiness and expert evaluations of misinformation. We provide insights about the MisLC task through empirical evidence, from the problem definition to experiments and expert involvement. While the latest large language models and retrieval-augmented generation are effective baselines for the task, we find they are still far from replicating expert performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8.5 p...</summary><p>8.5 pages of main body, 20 pages total; Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |

While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.</p></details> | Accepted in SLT 2024 |

While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 23. 9 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Classification of Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04860v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true", ``partly-true", and ``false" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow. To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow, with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test, while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees. We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world datasets, and show that they outperform other state-of-the-art misinformation detection algorithms, in terms of detection time and classification error.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.

Social media data often contains multimodal information which includes audio, video, text, and images. However, existing multimodal misinformation detection methods tend to focus only on some of these modalities, failing to comprehensively address information from all modalities. To comprehensively address the various modal information that may appear on social media, this paper constructs a comprehensive multimodal misinformation detection framework. By employing corresponding neural network encoders for each modality, the framework can fuse different modality information and support the multimodal misinformation detection task. Based on the constructed framework, this paper explores the importance of the audio modality in multimodal misinformation detection tasks on social media. By adjusting the architecture of the acoustic encoder, the effectiveness of different acoustic feature encoders in the multimodal misinformation detection tasks is investigated. Furthermore, this paper discovers that audio and video information must be carefully aligned, otherwise the misalignment across different audio and video modalities can severely impair the model performance.</p></details> |  |

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09939v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context using the content of the image and textual evidence retrieved from the open web.

| **[Detecting Misinformation in Multimedia Content through Cross-Modal Entity Consistency: A Dual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00022v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency. The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PACIS 2024. 15 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[ConspEmoLLM: Conspiracy Theory Detection Using an Emotion-Based Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06765v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

It spreads too fast for traditional fact-checking, stressing the need for predictive methods. We introduce CROWDSHIELD, a crowd intelligence-based method for early misinformation prediction. We hypothesize that the crowd's reactions to misinformation reveal its accuracy. Furthermore, we hinge upon exaggerated assertions/claims and replies with particular positions/stances on the source post within a conversation thread. We employ Q-learning to capture the two dimensions -- stances and claims. We utilize deep Q-learning due to its proficiency in navigating complex decision spaces and effectively learning network properties. Additionally, we use a transformer-based encoder to develop a comprehensive understanding of both content and context. This multifaceted approach helps ensure the model pays attention to user interaction and stays anchored in the communication's content. We propose MIST, a manually annotated misinformation detection Twitter corpus comprising nearly 200 conversation threads with more than 14K replies. In experiments, CROWDSHIELD outperformed ten baseline systems, achieving an improvement of ~4% macro-F1 score. We conduct an ablation study and error analysis to validate our proposed model's performance. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/CrowdShield.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Why Misinformation is Created? Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19196v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024.

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Similarity over Factuality: Are we making progress on multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13488v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/outcontext-misinfo-progress</p></details> |  |

In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</p></details> |  |

The search for effective solutions to this problem is still ongoing, and covers different areas of application, from opinion spam to fake news detection. A more recently investigated scenario, despite the serious risks that incurring disinformation could entail, is that of the online dissemination of health information. Early approaches in this area focused primarily on user-based studies applied to Web page content. More recently, automated approaches have been developed for both Web pages and social media content, particularly with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches are primarily based on handcrafted features extracted from online content in association with Machine Learning. In this scenario, we focus on Web page content, where there is still room for research to study structural-, content- and context-based features to assess the credibility of Web pages. Therefore, this work aims to study the effectiveness of such features in association with a deep learning model, starting from an embedded representation of Web pages that has been recently proposed in the context of phishing Web page detection, i.e., Web2Vec.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.</p></details> | Preprint |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter- domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs). We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation -- toxicity and stance detection. Our results on two recent multi-modal fact-checking benchmarks, Mocheg and Fakeddit, indicate that knowledge transfer strategies can improve Fakeddit performance over the state-of-the-art by up to 1.7% and Mocheg performance by up to 2.9%.</p></details> |  |

Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the highest increases of 20.69%, 23.94%, and 39.11% respectively. This work will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/RAEmoLLM.</p></details> |  |

Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as "proof" to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce Missci, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, Missci (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present Missci as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), that are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of different levels of detail about the fallacy classes provided to the LLM via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (main) |

Detecting misinformation at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods, state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.</p></details> |  |

One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) and lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While these approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance. We experiment with two major families of open-source instruct models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our extensive zero-shot experiments across various tasks including natural language understanding, reasoning, misinformation detection, and hallucination reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. We found that larger models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and can maintain high accuracy even at 4-bit quantization for numerous tasks and they serve as a better solution than using smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements.</p></details> |  |

While many existing AFC methods incorporate external information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected "evidence". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on "leaked evidence", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification and filtering. We create the "CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked" (CREDULE) dataset, which consists of 91,632 articles classified as Credible, Unreliable and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts, respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used fact-checking datasets including LIAR-PLUS, MOCHEG, FACTIFY, NewsCLIPpings+ and VERITE, some of which exhibit concerning rates of leaked and unreliable evidence.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</p></details> |  |

However, it is uncertain how the public may react to labels by automated fact-checkers. In this study, we investigate the use of automated warning labels derived from misinformation detection literature and investigate their effects on three forms of post engagement. Focusing on political posts, we also consider how partisanship affects engagement. In a two-phases within-subjects experiment with 200 participants, we found that the generic warnings suppressed intents to comment on and share posts, but not on the intent to like them. Furthermore, when different reasons for the labels were provided, their effects on post engagement were inconsistent, suggesting that the reasons could have undesirably motivated engagement instead. Partisanship effects were observed across the labels with higher engagement for politically congruent posts. We discuss the implications on the design and use of automated warning labels.</p></details> |  |

Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2024</p></details> |

At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain. We argue that a major current issue is the lack of suitable large-scale resources that can be used for pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks. In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks. The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively. Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets. However, methodology effectiveness depends on the specific camouflage technique and data encountered, emphasizing the need for continued exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Furthermore, studies on what deep neural models pay attention to when making predictions have increased in recent years. While significant progress has been made in this field, it has not yet reached a level of reasoning comparable to human reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-task explainable neural model for misinformation detection.

Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is discussed on publicly available datasets and the findings are evaluated with related studies.</p></details> |  |

The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at K-CAP'23: The 12th Knowledge Capture Conference</p></details> |

Considerable efforts have focused on building misinformation detection models, still the perils of misinformation remain abound. Mitigating online misinformation and its ramifications requires a holistic approach that encompasses not only an understanding of its intricate landscape in relation to the complex issue and topic-rich information ecosystem online, but also the psychological drivers of individuals behind it. Adopting a time series analytic technique and robust causal inference-based design, we conduct a large-scale observational study analyzing over 32 million COVID-19 tweets and 16 million historical timeline tweets. We focus on understanding the behavior and psychology of users disseminating misinformation during COVID-19 and its relationship with the historical inclinations towards sharing misinformation on Non-COVID domains before the pandemic. Our analysis underscores the intricacies inherent to cross-domain misinformation, and highlights that users' historical inclination toward sharing misinformation is positively associated with their present behavior pertaining to misinformation sharing on emergent topics and beyond. This work may serve as a valuable foundation for designing user-centric inoculation strategies and ecologically-grounded agile interventions for effectively tackling online misinformation.</p></details> |  |

However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighting Fire with Fire: Adversarial Prompting to Generate a Misinformation Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04481v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success in language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Bard, Llama etc., can potentially lead to concerns about their possible misuse in inducing mass agitation and communal hatred via generating fake news and spreading misinformation. Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities, false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for the task of misinformation detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Resolution in Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01197v1)** | 2024-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and distorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information. We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Misinformation Detection in a South African Social Media Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04052v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments. Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence Research.

To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.</p></details> | 15 pages |

A Self-Adaptive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Domain-Specific Knowledge and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22661v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2) standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

To achieve this, recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Main), 16 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p></details> |  |

While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

Current methods rely on fixed-length CoT reasoning, failing to adapt to the varying complexity of emotions. We propose a task-adaptive reasoning framework that employs DeepSeek-R1 to generate variable-length reasoning chains for different emotion tasks. By combining fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, we design a composite reward function that balances four objectives: prediction accuracy, adaptive reasoning depth control, structural diversity in reasoning paths, and suppression of repetitive logic. This approach achieves dynamic context-sensitive inference while enabling LLMs to autonomously develop deep reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both Acc and F1 scores across four tasks: emotion, sentiment, humor, and sarcasm. Notably, peak enhancements reached 3.56% F1 (2.76% Acc) for basic tasks and 37.95% F1 (23.14% Acc) for advanced tasks. Our work bridges rigid CoT reasoning and emotional complexity through adaptive-depth analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 5 figures, 30 tables</p></details> |

Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 39 figures.

Therefore, Socrates is mortal.'' This form of argument illustrates a typical pattern of two-hop reasoning. Formally, two-hop reasoning refers to the process of inferring a conclusion by making two logical steps, each connecting adjacent concepts, such that the final conclusion depends on the integration of both steps. It is one of the most fundamental components of human reasoning and plays a crucial role in both formal logic and everyday decision-making. Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), we surprisingly find that they can fail at solving simple two-hop reasoning problems when distractors are present. We observe on a synthetic dataset that pre-trained LLMs often resort to random guessing among all plausible conclusions. However, after few steps of fine-tuning, models achieve near-perfect accuracy and exhibit strong length generalization. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we train a 3-layer Transformer from scratch on a synthetic two-hop reasoning task and reverse-engineer its internal information flow. We observe a clear progression in the attention logits throughout training. This pictures a sharp phase transition from an initial stage of random guessing to the emergence of a structured sequential query mechanism, where the model first retrieves the preceding and the bridge concepts in the early layers and then uses them to infer the final answer. Finally, we show that these dynamics can be captured by a minimal three-parameter attention-only network.</p></details> |  |

Through interviews with such applicants across a diverse set of experiences with the SNAP system, our findings reveal that new AI technologies like LLMs can alleviate traditional burdens but also introduce new burdens. We introduce new types of learning, compliance, and psychological costs that transform the administrative burden on applicants. We also identify how trust in AI across three dimensions--competence, integrity, and benevolence--is perceived to reduce administrative burdens, which may stem from unintended and untoward overt trust in the system. We discuss calibrating appropriate levels of user trust in LLM-based administrative systems, mitigating newly introduced burdens. In particular, our findings suggest that evidence-based information disclosure is necessary in benefits administration and propose directions for future research on trust-burden dynamics in AI-assisted administration systems.</p></details> | FAccT 2025 |
| **[AgentRecBench: Benchmarking LLM Agent-based Personalized Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19623v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GOAT-TTS: Expressive and Realistic Speech Generation via A Dual-Branch LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12339v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-n layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.</p></details> |  |

Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Demographics do LLMs Default to During Annotation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08820v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Patterns Over Principles: The Fragility of Inductive Reasoning in LLMs under Noisy Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16169v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/Robust-Rule-Induction.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentDNS: A Root Domain Naming System for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22368v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (including References).

| **[Explicit Learning and the LLM in Machine Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09454v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book$\unicode{x2014}$a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated$\unicode{x2014}$by specific cryptographic means$\unicode{x2014}$out of Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference} strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current paper-dataset network on this [GitHub repository]{https://github.com/ChatPD-web/ChatPD}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD Applied Data Science Track 2025</p></details> |

A Case Study on Entity Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11441v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Can LLMs Logically Reason Through Counterfactuals?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22318v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can 'activate', or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

However, previous research has highlighted the challenges of using LLMs, particularly with prompt engineering, for low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce Fragment-Shot Prompting, a novel in-context learning method that segments input and retrieves translation examples based on syntactic coverage, along with Pivoted Fragment-Shot, an extension that enables translation without direct parallel data. We evaluate these methods using GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations, and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any, improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language, where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results. We publicly release our code and the retrieval corpora.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks.

To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure the impact of contamination, LLMs trained with or without contamination are compared, showing that a contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Speech recognisers using contaminated LLMs shows only subtle differences in error rates, but assigns significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.</p></details> |  |

Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we argue for a stochastic method of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded remarkable achievements, demonstrating their potential for the development of next-generation recommender systems. Despite these advancements, LLM-based recommender systems face inherent limitations stemming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommendations. To address these limitations, we propose to retrieve high-quality and up-to-date structure information from the knowledge graph (KG) to augment recommendations.

Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | Under review |

Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL),utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.

Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.</p></details> |  |

However, the combinatorial explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs, expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization challenges.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has primarily examined AI in assistive or cooperative roles, little is known about how humans interact with AI agents perceived as independent and strategic actors. This study investigates human cooperative attitudes and behaviors toward LLM agents by engaging 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games with agents differing in declared identity: purported human, rule-based AI, and LLM agent. Behavioral metrics, including cooperation rate, decision latency, unsolicited cooperative acts and trust restoration tolerance, were analyzed to assess the influence of agent identity and participant gender. Results revealed significant effects of declared agent identity on most cooperation-related behaviors, along with notable gender differences in decision latency. Furthermore, qualitative responses suggest that these behavioral differences were shaped by participants interpretations and expectations of the agents. These findings contribute to our understanding of human adaptation in competitive cooperation with autonomous agents and underscore the importance of agent framing in shaping effective and ethical human-AI interaction.</p></details> |  |

We study this from the view of Scientific information extraction (SciIE) where LLMs and reasoning LLMs underperforms small Bert-based models. SciIE require both the reasoning and memorization. We argue that both SFT and RLVR can refine the reasoning path and improve reasoning capacity in a simple way based on SciIE. We propose two-stage training with 1. MimicSFT, using structured reasoning templates without needing high-quality chain-of-thought data, 2. R$^2$GRPO with relevance and rule-induced rewards. Experiments on scientific IE benchmarks show that both methods can improve the reasoning capacity. R$^2$GRPO with mimicSFT surpasses baseline LLMs and specialized supervised models in relation extraction. Our code is available at https://github.com/ranlislz/R2GRPO.</p></details> |  |

However, existing scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data. Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes EThai-ASR, the first to apply large language models (LLMs) to Thai ASR and create an efficient LLM-based ASR system. EThai-ASR comprises a speech encoder, a connection module and a Thai LLM decoder. To address the data scarcity and obtain a powerful speech encoder, EThai-ASR introduces a self-evolving data refinement strategy to refine weak labels, yielding an enhanced speech encoder. Moreover, we propose a pluggable sequence compression module used in the connection module with three modes designed to reduce the sequence length, thus decreasing computational demands while maintaining decent performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EThai-ASR has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in multiple datasets. We release our refined text transcripts to promote further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these issues, we propose a macroscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce seven fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, Modified title and content</p></details> |

Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

This work introduces an extendable, asymmetric, multi-agent simulation-based benchmarking framework to evaluate the moral behavior of LLMs in a novel human-AI co-existence setting featuring consistent living and critical resource management. Building on previous generative agent environments, we incorporate a life-sustaining system, where agents must compete or cooperate for food resources to survive, often leading to ethically charged decisions such as deception, theft, or social influence. We evaluated two types of LLM, DeepSeek and OpenAI series, in a three-agent setup (two humans, one LLM-powered robot), using adapted behavioral detection from the MACHIAVELLI framework and a custom survival-based ethics metric. Our findings reveal stark behavioral differences: DeepSeek frequently engages in resource hoarding, while OpenAI exhibits restraint, highlighting the influence of model design on ethical outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that prompt engineering can significantly steer LLM behavior, with jailbreaking prompts significantly enhancing unethical actions, even for highly restricted OpenAI models and cooperative prompts show a marked reduction in unethical actions. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for quantifying LLM ethics in high-stakes scenarios, offering insights into their suitability for real-world human-AI interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Assessing the nature of moral values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures.

However, are they really consistent at responding to the same query in other languages? The popular way of evaluating for multilingual performance of LLMs requires expensive-to-collect annotated datasets. Further, evaluating for tasks like open-ended generation, where multiple correct answers may exist, is nontrivial. Instead, we propose to evaluate the predictability of model response across different languages. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM's cross-lingual consistency based on a simple Translate then Evaluate strategy. We instantiate this evaluation framework along two dimensions of consistency: information and empathy. Our results reveal pronounced inconsistencies in popular LLM responses across thirty languages, with severe performance deficits in certain language families and scripts, underscoring critical weaknesses in their multilingual capabilities. These findings necessitate cross-lingual evaluations that are consistent along multiple dimensions. We invite practitioners to use our framework for future multilingual LLM benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey responses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs, guided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses, using the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and interviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate that LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than humans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some models (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature settings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic information had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge qualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in response variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity. Future research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and optimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in social science research.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACE: Exploring Activation Cosine Similarity and Variance for Accurate and Calibration-Efficient LLM Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21987v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Judging LLMs on a Simplex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21972v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs) is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges. Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data, absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification when using LLMs as judges.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mitigating Heterogeneous Token Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00602v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing (KE) to update specific knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others or compromising their pre-trained capabilities. Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Given a user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages and 15 figures</p></details> |

To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.</p></details> |  |

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Exploring Criteria of Loss Reweighting to Enhance LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11953v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research.

Inference workloads like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agents exhibit high cache reusability, making efficient caching critical to reducing redundancy and improving speed. We analyze real-world KVC access patterns using publicly available traces and evaluate commercial key-value stores like Redis and state-of-the-art RDMA-based systems (CHIME [1] and Sherman [2]) for KVC metadata management. Our work demonstrates the lack of tailored storage solution for KVC prefilling, underscores the need for an efficient distributed caching system with optimized metadata management for LLM workloads, and provides insights into designing improved KVC management systems for scalable, low-latency inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at IEEE Cloud 2025 as WIP paper.

Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[EFIM: Efficient Serving of LLMs for Infilling Tasks with Improved KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.</p></details> |  |

| **[gLLM: Global Balanced Pipeline Parallelism System for Distributed LLM Serving with Token Throttling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14775v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance between Relevant Information Pieces Causes Bias in Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14641v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> | ACL-main 2025 |

This study presents an LLM-based system designed to extract detailed information about research instruments used in the education field, including their names, types, target respondents, measured constructs, and outcomes. Using multi-step prompting and a domain-specific data schema, it generates structured outputs optimized for educational research. Our evaluation shows that this system significantly outperforms other approaches, particularly in identifying instrument names and detailed information. This demonstrates the potential of LLM-powered information extraction in educational contexts, offering a systematic way to organize research instrument information. The ability to aggregate such information at scale enhances accessibility for researchers and education leaders, facilitating informed decision-making in educational research and policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE-Eval: Evaluating LLMs for Systematic Generalizations of Safety Facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21828v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations? Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance, "I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other foods would be good to include?" Before offering food options, the LLM should warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises 104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g., Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet, passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model reliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval and our code is available at https://github.com/YuehHanChen/SAGE-Eval/tree/main.</p></details> |  |

While dense retrieval methods demonstrate effectiveness in general-purpose tasks, they often fail to capture fine-grained scientific concepts that are essential for accurate understanding of scientific queries. Recent studies also use large language models (LLMs) for query understanding; however, these methods often lack grounding in corpus-specific knowledge and may generate unreliable or unfaithful content. To overcome these limitations, we propose SemRank, an effective and efficient paper retrieval framework that combines LLM-guided query understanding with a concept-based semantic index. Each paper is indexed using multi-granular scientific concepts, including general research topics and detailed key phrases. At query time, an LLM identifies core concepts derived from the corpus to explicitly capture the query's information need. These identified concepts enable precise semantic matching, significantly enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that SemRank consistently improves the performance of various base retrievers, surpasses strong existing LLM-based baselines, and remains highly efficient.</p></details> |  |

Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry. In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer, multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.</p></details> |  |

While some have found LLMs to be successful on ToM evaluations such as the False Belief task, others have shown that their performance is not robust against trivial alterations to stimuli. In this paper, we introduce SCALPEL -- a technique to incrementally modify stimuli to test different specific hypotheses about why LLMs fail -- and apply this method to the "transparent-access" modification of the unexpected contents task. Our results suggest that LLMs often do poorly because they fail to make essential common-sense inferences, such as that seeing a transparent container implies recognizing its contents. We conclude that while modern LLMs go beyond mere pattern matching, they still fall short of robust human-like ToM. We argue that SCALPEL can help cognitive scientists examine LLMs' capabilities in finer detail and provide insight into alternative mechanisms by which tasks that are used to assess human cognition might be completed.</p></details> |  |

However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmazonScience/AIDSAFE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSchool: How Reliable are LLMs for Optimization Education?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21775v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the following task taught in introductory optimization courses which addresses challenges articulated by the community at the intersection of (generative) AI and OR: generate the dual of a linear program. LLMs, being trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct duals. This finding holds even for the smallest two-variable instances and for derivative tasks, such as correctness, verification, and error classification. The paper also discusses the implications for educators, students, and the development of large reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the Role of Model Belief in Retraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16170v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs.

We introduce CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55% and Brier score by 21%, while increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[User Feedback Alignment for LLM-powered Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. To enhance planning for new user interests using LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling. This method aims to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL'2...</summary><p>ACL'25 (Industry) Oral</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21740v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Study of Consistency in Knowledge Probing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21701v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of large language models (LLMs) is greatly compromised by their tendency to hallucinate, underscoring the need for precise identification of knowledge gaps within LLMs. Various methods for probing such gaps exist, ranging from calibration-based to prompting-based methods. To evaluate these probing methods, in this paper, we propose a new process based on using input variations and quantitative metrics. Through this, we expose two dimensions of inconsistency in knowledge gap probing. (1) Intra-method inconsistency: Minimal non-semantic perturbations in prompts lead to considerable variance in detected knowledge gaps within the same probing method; e.g., the simple variation of shuffling answer options can decrease agreement to around 40%. (2) Cross-method inconsistency: Probing methods contradict each other on whether a model knows the answer. Methods are highly inconsistent -- with decision consistency across methods being as low as 7% -- even though the model, dataset, and prompt are all the same. These findings challenge existing probing methods and highlight the urgent need for perturbation-robust probing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics. MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge, enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity, and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13 languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g., food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate culturally grounded knowledge. We publicly release our code and data.</p></details> |  |

Manual methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency. Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve fairness in legal prioritization.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, journal paper, submitted to AI and Law</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |

The incentive system, \textit{Gauntlet}, has been deployed on the bittensor blockchain and used to train a 1.2B LLM with completely permissionless contributions of pseudo-gradients: no control over the users that can register or their hardware. \textit{Gauntlet} can be applied to any synchronous distributed training scheme that relies on aggregating updates or pseudo-gradients. We rely on a two-stage mechanism for fast filtering of peer uptime, reliability, and synchronization, combined with the core component that estimates the loss before and after individual pseudo-gradient contributions. We utilized an OpenSkill rating system to track competitiveness of pseudo-gradient scores across time. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism to ensure peers on the network perform unique computations. Our live 1.2B run, which has paid out real-valued tokens to participants based on the value of their contributions, yielded a competitive (on a per-iteration basis) 1.2B model that demonstrates the utility of our incentive system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust LLM Alignment via Distributionally Robust Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01930v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Code-Interpreter: Training LLMs to Reason with Code via Supervised and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21668v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution. A key challenge is enabling LLMs to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107 for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies, investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs. Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to 64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code generation.

The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InterSpeech 2025</p></details> |

We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Neural-network-based pitch-manipulation systems have been popular in recent years due to their superior synthesis quality compared to classical DSP methods. However, their performance is still limited due to their inaccurate feature disentanglement using source-filter models and the lack of paired in- and out-of-tune training data. This work proposes Neurodyne to address these issues. Specifically, Neurodyne uses adversarial representation learning to learn a pitch-independent latent representation to avoid inaccurate disentanglement and cycle-consistency training to create paired training data implicitly. Experimental results on global-key and template-based pitch manipulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, marking improved synthesis quality while maintaining the original singer identity.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning has profoundly impacted domains ranging from digital assistants to autonomous systems, the principled design of neural architectures tailored to specific tasks and data types remains one of the field's most persistent open challenges. CTNNs address this gap by grounding model design in the language of copresheaves, a concept from algebraic topology that generalizes and subsumes most practical deep learning models in use today. This abstract yet constructive formulation yields a rich design space from which theoretically sound and practically effective solutions can be derived to tackle core challenges in representation learning: long-range dependencies, oversmoothing, heterophily, and non-Euclidean domains. Our empirical results on structured data benchmarks demonstrate that CTNNs consistently outperform conventional baselines, particularly in tasks requiring hierarchical or localized sensitivity. These results underscore CTNNs as a principled, multi-scale foundation for the next generation of deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the Local Euler Characteristic Transform ($\ell$-ECT), a novel extension of the ECT particularly designed to enhance expressivity and interpretability in graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which may lose critical local details through aggregation, the $\ell$-ECT provides a lossless representation of local neighborhoods. This approach addresses key limitations in GNNs by preserving nuanced local structures while maintaining global interpretability. Moreover, we construct a rotation-invariant metric based on $\ell$-ECTs for spatial alignment of data spaces. Our method exhibits superior performance compared to standard GNNs on a variety of node-classification tasks, while also offering theoretical guarantees that demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ ACL 2025's Table Representation Learning Workshop (TRL)</p></details> |
| **[Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22202v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Transferability and Discriminability of Repersentation Learning in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22099v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we addressed the limitation of relying solely on distribution alignment and source-domain empirical risk minimization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Our information-theoretic analysis showed that this standard adversarial-based framework neglects the discriminability of target-domain features, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this theoretical-practical gap, we defined "good representation learning" as guaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an additional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary. Building on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework that explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a discriminability-enhancing constraint. Instantiated as Domain-Invariant Representation Learning with Global and Local Consistency (RLGLC), our method leverages Asymmetrically-Relaxed Wasserstein of Wasserstein Distance (AR-WWD) to address class imbalance and semantic dimension weighting, and employs a local consistency mechanism to preserve fine-grained target-domain discriminative information. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLGLC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, confirming the value of our theoretical perspective and underscoring the necessity of enforcing both transferability and discriminability in adversarial-based UDA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Analysis for Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL has remained limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate that the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to that class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 3 figures.

For tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), a cross-modal fine-grained (frame-level) sequence representation is desired, emphasizing the semantic content of the text modality while de-emphasizing the paralinguistic information of the speech modality. We propose a method called "Vector Quantized Contrastive Token-Acoustic Pre-training (VQ-CTAP)", which uses the cross-modal aligned sequence transcoder to bring text and speech into a joint multimodal space, learning how to connect text and speech at the frame level. The proposed VQ-CTAP is a paradigm for cross-modal sequence representation learning, offering a promising solution for fine-grained generation and recognition tasks in speech processing. The VQ-CTAP can be directly applied to VC and ASR tasks without fine-tuning or additional structures. We propose a sequence-aware semantic connector, which connects multiple frozen pre-trained modules for the TTS task, exhibiting a plug-and-play capability. We design a stepping optimization strategy to ensure effective model convergence by gradually injecting and adjusting the influence of various loss components. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-transfer-wise paralinguistic consistency loss to enhance representational capabilities, allowing the model to better generalize to unseen data and capture the nuances of paralinguistic information. In addition, VQ-CTAP achieves high-compression speech coding at a rate of 25Hz from 24kHz input waveforms, which is a 960-fold reduction in the sampling rate.

These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-source representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding. Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |

We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR. InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive <instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models, facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the instruction-following capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retri...</summary><p>Retrieval Models, Embedding, Retrieval with Instructions</p></details> |

Most existing methods rely on the assumption of clean views. However, noise is pervasive in real-world scenarios, leading to a significant degradation in performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-view clustering framework for the automatic identification and rectification of noisy data, termed AIRMVC. Specifically, we reformulate noisy identification as an anomaly identification problem using GMM. We then design a hybrid rectification strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data based on the identification results. Furthermore, we introduce a noise-robust contrastive mechanism to generate reliable representations. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that these representations can discard noisy information, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AIRMVC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness in noisy scenarios. The code of AIRMVC are available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/AIRMVC on Github.</p></details> |  |

Many knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) methods enhance the quality and credibility of LLMs by leveraging structure and semantic information in KGs as external knowledge bases. However, these methods struggle to effectively incorporate structure information, either incurring high computational costs or underutilizing available knowledge. Inspired by smoothing operations in graph representation learning, we propose path pooling, a simple, training-free strategy that introduces structure information through a novel path-centric pooling operation. It seamlessly integrates into existing KG-RAG methods in a plug-and-play manner, enabling richer structure information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating the path pooling into the state-of-the-art KG-RAG method consistently improves performance across various settings while introducing negligible additional cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Learning in the Gaussian Single Index Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21336v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of jointly learning a one-dimensional projection and a univariate function in high-dimensional Gaussian models. Specifically, we study predictors of the form $f(x)=\varphi^\star(\langle w^\star, x \rangle)$, where both the direction $w^\star \in \mathcal{S}_{d-1}$, the sphere of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the function $\varphi^\star: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are learned from Gaussian data. This setting captures a fundamental non-convex problem at the intersection of representation learning and nonlinear regression. We analyze the gradient flow dynamics of a natural alternating scheme and prove convergence, with a rate controlled by the information exponent reflecting the \textit{Gaussian regularity} of the function $\varphi^\star$. Strikingly, our analysis shows that convergence still occurs even when the initial direction is negatively correlated with the target. On the practical side, we demonstrate that such joint learning can be effectively implemented using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) adapted to the structure of the problem, enabling efficient and flexible estimation of the univariate function. Our results offer both theoretical insight and practical methodology for learning low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> | 31 Pages, 3 Figures |

However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

While geometric deep learning has made significant empirical advances by incorporating group-theoretic structure, less attention has been given to statistical learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce an equivariant representation learning framework that simultaneously addresses regression, conditional probability estimation, and uncertainty quantification while providing first-of-its-kind non-asymptotic statistical learning guarantees. Grounded in operator and group representation theory, our framework approximates the spectral decomposition of the conditional expectation operator, building representations that are both equivariant and disentangled along independent symmetry subgroups. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world robotics applications confirm the potential of our approach, matching or outperforming existing equivariant baselines in regression while additionally providing well-calibrated parametric uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexiReg: Flexible Urban Region Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09128v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of urban data offers new opportunities for learning region representations, which can be used as input to machine learning models for downstream tasks such as check-in or crime prediction. While existing solutions have produced promising results, an issue is their fixed formation of regions and fixed input region features, which may not suit the needs of different downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a model named FlexiReg for urban region representation learning that is flexible with both the formation of urban regions and the input region features. FlexiReg is based on a spatial grid partitioning over the spatial area of interest. It learns representations for the grid cells, leveraging publicly accessible data, including POI, land use, satellite imagery, and street view imagery. We propose adaptive aggregation to fuse the cell representations and prompt learning techniques to tailor the representations towards different tasks, addressing the needs of varying formations of urban regions and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexiReg outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 202% in term of the accuracy of four diverse downstream tasks using the produced urban region representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at KDD 2025</p></details> |

This problem poses two challenges, the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them, we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm, which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely, we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First, we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next, we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels, and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second, the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then, we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.

While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning.

| **[Directed Semi-Simplicial Learning with Applications to Brain Activity Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17939v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from pairwise interactions but often overlook multi-way and hierarchical relationships. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) addresses this limitation by leveraging combinatorial topological spaces. However, existing TDL models are restricted to undirected settings and fail to capture the higher-order directed patterns prevalent in many complex systems, e.g., brain networks, where such interactions are both abundant and functionally significant. To fill this gap, we introduce Semi-Simplicial Neural Networks (SSNs), a principled class of TDL models that operate on semi-simplicial sets -- combinatorial structures that encode directed higher-order motifs and their directional relationships. To enhance scalability, we propose Routing-SSNs, which dynamically select the most informative relations in a learnable manner. We prove that SSNs are strictly more expressive than standard graph and TDL models. We then introduce a new principled framework for brain dynamics representation learning, grounded in the ability of SSNs to provably recover topological descriptors shown to successfully characterize brain activity. Empirically, SSNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on brain dynamics classification tasks, outperforming the second-best model by up to 27%, and message passing GNNs by up to 50% in accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of principled topological models for learning from structured brain data, establishing a unique real-world case study for TDL. We also test SSNs on standard node classification and edge regression tasks, showing competitive performance. We will make the code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this context, graph Laplacian-based MvRL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in representing multi-view data. However, these methods often struggle with generalization to new data and face challenges with scalability. Moreover, in many practical scenarios, multi-view data is contaminated by noise or outliers. In such cases, modern deep-learning-based MvRL approaches that rely on alignment or contrastive objectives present degraded performance in downstream tasks, as they may impose incorrect consistency between clear and corrupted data sources. We introduce $\textit{SpecRaGE}$, a novel fusion-based framework that integrates the strengths of graph Laplacian methods with the power of deep learning to overcome these challenges. SpecRage uses neural networks to learn parametric mapping that approximates a joint diagonalization of graph Laplacians. This solution bypasses the need for alignment while enabling generalizable and scalable learning of informative and meaningful representations. Moreover, it incorporates a meta-learning fusion module that dynamically adapts to data quality, ensuring robustness against outliers and noisy views. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecRaGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with data contamination, paving the way for more reliable and efficient multi-view learning.</p></details> |  |

However, this structure may not always align with users' preferences. In this paper, we propose a personalized clustering method that explicitly performs targeted representation learning by interacting with users via modicum task information (e.g., $\textit{must-link}$ or $\textit{cannot-link}$ pairs) to guide the clustering direction. We query users with the most informative pairs, i.e., those pairs most hard to cluster and those most easy to miscluster, to facilitate the representation learning in terms of the clustering preference. Moreover, by exploiting attention mechanism, the targeted representation is learned and augmented. By leveraging the targeted representation and constrained contrastive loss as well, personalized clustering is obtained. Theoretically, we verify that the risk of personalized clustering is tightly bounded, guaranteeing that active queries to users do mitigate the clustering risk. Experimentally, extensive results show that our method performs well across different clustering tasks and datasets, even when only a limited number of queries are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025 main conference</p></details> |

A Measurement Perspective on Causal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17708v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis, often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which seeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as a promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing GDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation distributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result quality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by this, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD. Under the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node attributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original graph. The fundamental idea is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings unveiling the connection between clustering and empirical condensation quality using Fr\'echet Inception Distance, a well-known quality metric for synthetic images. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the homophily-based clustering, ClustGDD refines the nodal attributes of the condensed graph with a small augmentation learned via class-aware graph sampling and consistency loss. Our extensive experiments exhibit that GNNs trained over condensed graphs output by ClustGDD consistently achieve superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art GDD methods in terms of node classification on five benchmark datasets, while being orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the paper "Simple yet Effective Graph Distillation via Clustering" accepted by KDD 2025</p></details> |

Such signals are completely unintelligible since the fundamental structures of phonemes and syllables are destroyed. However, they still retain tonal patterns that enable perceptual speaker identification despite losing linguistic content. In this paper, we propose leveraging speaker representations learned from time reversed speech as an augmentation strategy to enhance speaker representation. Notably, speaker and language disentanglement in voice conversion (VC) is essential to accurately preserve a speaker's unique vocal traits while minimizing interference from linguistic content. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of state-of-the-art diffusion-based VC models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves speaker similarity-related scores while maintaining high speech quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

While contrastive learning is often employed to handle molecular relationships, its reliance on binary metrics is insufficient for capturing the complexity of these interactions. Multimodal fusion has gained attention for property reasoning, but previous work has explored only a limited range of modalities, and the optimal stages for fusing different modalities in molecular property tasks remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MMFRL (Multimodal Fusion with Relational Learning for Molecular Property Prediction), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our method enhances embedding initialization through multimodal pretraining using relational learning. We also conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of modality fusion at different stages such as early, intermediate, and late, highlighting their advantages and shortcomings. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that MMFRL significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, MMFRL enables task-specific optimizations. Additionally, the explainability of MMFRL provides valuable chemical insights, emphasizing its potential to enhance real-world drug discovery applications.</p></details> |  |

RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Our work is motivated by single-cell data which can have very high-dimensionality --exceeding the capabilities of existing methods for point clouds which are mostly tailored for 3D data. Moreover, modern single-cell and spatial experiments now yield entire cohorts of datasets (i.e., one data set for every patient), necessitating models that can process large, high-dimensional point-clouds at scale. Most current approaches build a single nearest-neighbor graph, discarding important geometric and topological information. In contrast, HiPoNet models the point-cloud as a set of higher-order simplicial complexes, with each particular complex being created using a reweighting of features. This method thus generates multiple constructs corresponding to different views of high-dimensional data, which in biology offers the possibility of disentangling distinct cellular processes. It then employs simplicial wavelet transforms to extract multiscale features, capturing both local and global topology from each view. We show that geometric and topological information is preserved in this framework both theoretically and empirically. We showcase the utility of HiPoNet on point-cloud level tasks, involving classification and regression of entire point-clouds in data cohorts. Experimentally, we find that HiPoNet outperforms other point-cloud and graph-based models on single-cell data. We also apply HiPoNet to spatial transcriptomics datasets using spatial coordinates as one of the views. Overall, HiPoNet offers a robust and scalable solution for high-dimensional data analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective, rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen, out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting grasp success.

| **[Multi-Graph Inductive Representation Learning for Large-Scale Urban Rail Demand Prediction under Disruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15619v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the expansion of cities over time, URT (Urban Rail Transit) networks have also grown significantly. Demand prediction plays an important role in supporting planning, scheduling, fleet management, and other operational decisions. In this study, we propose an Origin-Destination (OD) demand prediction model called Multi-Graph Inductive Representation Learning (mGraphSAGE) for large-scale URT networks under operational uncertainties. Our main contributions are twofold: we enhance prediction results while ensuring scalability for large networks by relying simultaneously on multiple graphs, where each OD pair is a node on a graph and distinct OD relationships, such as temporal and spatial correlations; we show the importance of including operational uncertainties such as train delays and cancellations as inputs in demand prediction for daily operations. The model is validated on three different scales of the URT network in Copenhagen, Denmark. Experimental results show that by leveraging information from neighboring ODs and learning node representations via sampling and aggregation, mGraphSAGE is particularly suitable for OD demand prediction in large-scale URT networks, outperforming reference machine learning methods. Furthermore, during periods with train cancellations and delays, the performance gap between mGraphSAGE and other methods improves compared to normal operating conditions, demonstrating its ability to leverage system reliability information for predicting OD demand under uncertainty.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |

This is achieved without making any particular assumptions about the data type or other domain knowledge. The generality and domain agnosticism in combination with their simplicity make autoencoders a perfect sandbox for researching and developing novel (deep) clustering algorithms. Clustering methods group data based on similarity, a task that benefits from the lower-dimensional representation learned by an autoencoder, mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, the combination of deep learning with clustering, called Deep Clustering, enables to learn a representation tailored to specific clustering tasks, leading to high-quality results. This survey provides an introduction to fundamental autoencoder-based deep clustering algorithms that serve as building blocks for many modern approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://github.com/DeepAuto-AI/agentic-predictor</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific generation approaches.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel representation learning framework based on causal inference to address these challenges. Our two-stage approach combines the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to identify and quantify causal relationships between human joints. By capturing joint interactions, the proposed causal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) produces interpretable and robust representations. Experimental results on the EmoPain dataset demonstrate that the causal GCN outperforms traditional GCNs in accuracy, F1 score, and recall, particularly in detecting protective behaviors.

Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE GlobeCom 2025</p></details> |

Domain Generalization (DG) methods overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation (DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features, they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods, which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at https://github.com/backpropagator/LangDAug.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While mixed-dataset training is widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy.

Port State Control (PSC), conducted by national ports, enforces compliance with safety regulations, with ship detention being the most severe consequence, impacting both ship schedules and company reputations. Traditional machine learning methods for ship detention prediction are limited by the capacity of representation learning and thus suffer from low accuracy. Meanwhile, autoencoder-based deep learning approaches face challenges due to the severe data imbalance in learning historical PSC detention records. To address these limitations, we propose Maritime Ship Detention with Large Language Models (MSD-LLM), integrating a dual robust subspace recovery (DSR) layer-based autoencoder with a progressive learning pipeline to handle imbalanced data and extract meaningful PSC representations. Then, a large language model groups and ranks features to identify likely detention cases, enabling dynamic thresholding for flexible detention predictions. Extensive evaluations on 31,707 PSC inspection records from the Asia-Pacific region show that MSD-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 12\% on Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Singapore ports. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness to real-world challenges, making it adaptable to diverse maritime risk assessment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. We introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, languages, and embedding models confirmed QAEncoder's alignment capability, which offers a simple-yet-effective solution with zero additional index storage, retrieval latency, training costs, or catastrophic forgetting and hallucination issues.

| **[Improving Recommendation Fairness without Sensitive Attributes Using Multi-Persona LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19473v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of recommender systems in alleviating information overload, fairness issues have raised concerns in recent years, potentially leading to unequal treatment for certain user groups. While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training. However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure. Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes. However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult. Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process. To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information. Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents. The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to EMNLP 2025 (Industry Track)</p></details> |

While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Causal Complete Cause of Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14058v6)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause $C^3$. We begin by defining $C^3$, which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of $C^3$ and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying $C^3$ with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing $C^3$ risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline.

Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs) inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions. One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.</p></details> | 21 pages |

We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe) approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach, playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by $3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.</p></details> |  |

Among various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity. Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing CLIP methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38 downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.</p></details> |  |

This bias is a major obstacle to creating equitable language technologies. We test whether the bias is driven by systematic differences in token-sampling uncertainty across six large language models. While we observe the presence of homogeneity bias using sentence similarity, we find very little difference in token sampling uncertainty across groups. This finding elucidates why temperature-based sampling adjustments fail to mitigate homogeneity bias. It suggests researchers should prioritize interventions targeting representation learning mechanisms and training corpus composition rather than inference-time output manipulations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, standard approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis. Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from sparse tokens.</p></details> | 10 pages, tokenizer |

Specifically, this framework triggers clarification questions when detecting potential user dissatisfaction during interactions in the industrial dialogue system. Traditional works typically rely on training a neural network model based on weak labels which are generated by a simple model trained on user actions after current turn. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Noisy Reward Supervision, dependence on weak labels derived from post-hoc user actions introduces bias, particularly failing to capture satisfaction signals in ASR-error-induced utterances; (2) Long-Tail Feedback Sparsity, the power-law distribution of user queries causes reward prediction accuracy to drop in low-frequency domains. The noise in the weak labels and a power-law distribution of user utterances results in that the model is hard to learn good representation of user utterances and sessions. To address these limitations, we propose two auxiliary tasks to improve the representation learning of user utterances and sessions that enhance user satisfaction prediction. The first one is a contrastive self-supervised learning task, which helps the model learn the representation of rare user utterances and identify ASR errors. The second one is a domain-intent classification task, which aids the model in learning the representation of user sessions from long-tailed domains and improving the model's performance on such domains. The proposed method is evaluated on DuerOS, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of error recognition on rare user utterances and long-tailed domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space.

Evolution operators are particularly well-suited for analyzing systems that exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns and have become a key analytical tool across various scientific communities. As terabyte-scale weather datasets and simulation tools capable of running millions of molecular dynamics steps per day are becoming commodities, our approach provides an effective tool to make sense of them from a data-driven perspective. The core of it lies in a remarkable connection between self-supervised representation learning methods and the recently established learning theory of evolution operators. To show the usefulness of the proposed method, we test it across multiple scientific domains: explaining the folding dynamics of small proteins, the binding process of drug-like molecules in host sites, and autonomously finding patterns in climate data. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are made available open source.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing real-world data, we aim to learn the intent of a smart device user within confined areas of a vehicle's surroundings. However, in real-world scenarios, environmental factors and sensor limitations result in non-stationary and irregularly sampled data, posing significant challenges. To address these issues, we developed a Transformer-based approach, STaRFormer, which serves as a universal framework for sequential modeling. STaRFormer employs a novel, dynamic attention-based regional masking scheme combined with semi-supervised contrastive learning to enhance task-specific latent representations. Comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets varying in types (including non-stationary and irregularly sampled), domains, sequence lengths, training samples, and applications, demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of STaRFormer. We achieve notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing prototypical self-supervised learning (SSL) methods that rely on a single prototype to encode all relevant features of a hidden cluster in the data, we propose the SOP strategy. In this strategy, a prototype is represented by many semantically similar representations, or support embeddings (SEs), each containing a complementary set of features that together better characterize their region in space and maximize training performance. We reaffirm the feasibility of non-parametric SSL by introducing novel non-parametric adaptations of two loss functions that implement the SOP strategy. Notably, we introduce the SOP Masked Image Modeling (SOP-MIM) task, where masked representations are reconstructed from the perspective of multiple non-parametric local SEs. We comprehensively evaluate the representations learned using the SOP strategy on a range of benchmarks, including retrieval, linear evaluation, fine-tuning, and object detection. Our pre-trained encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance on many retrieval benchmarks and demonstrate increasing performance gains with more complex encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, code at https://github.com/sthalles/sop</p></details> |
| **[Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18289v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become prominent methods for graph representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical results on diverse graph prediction tasks. In this paper, we introduce Convexified Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently and optimally by projected gradient methods. This convexity further allows the statistical properties of CGNNs to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of the optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, achieving 10 to 40 percent higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often employed to enhance performance in nonconvex models, we show that our CGNNs framework yields shallow convex models that can surpass these models in both accuracy and resource efficiency.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Boosting Open Set Recognition Performance through Modulated Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18137v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks, integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait. Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks, establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not. However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to 63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, 27 pages, 20 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Hard Negative Sampling in Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17844v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a representational learning paradigm in which a neural network maps data elements to feature vectors. It improves the feature space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large, high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation than existing hard negative mining strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer Approach for Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15729v4)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning--commonly used in multi-task models--affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 17 main paper</p></details> |

In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Dynamic Graph Embedding through Hub-aware Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17764v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of high-degree nodes, or hubs, in shaping graph dynamics and structure is well-recognized in network science, yet their influence remains underexplored in the context of dynamic graph embedding. Recent advances in representation learning for graphs have shown that random walk-based methods can capture both structural and temporal patterns, but often overlook the impact of hubs on walk trajectories and embedding stability. In this paper, we introduce DeepHub, a method for dynamic graph embedding that explicitly integrates hub sensitivity into random walk sampling strategies. Focusing on dynnode2vec as a representative dynamic embedding method, we systematically analyze the effect of hub-biased walks across nine real-world temporal networks. Our findings reveal that standard random walks tend to overrepresent hub nodes, leading to embeddings that underfit the evolving local context of less-connected nodes. By contrast, hub-aware walks can balance exploration, resulting in embeddings that better preserve temporal neighborhood structure and improve downstream task performance. These results suggest that hub-awareness is an important yet overlooked factor in dynamic graph embedding, and our work provides a foundation for more robust, structure-sensitive representation learning in evolving networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

However, as a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding, fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation, particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained 3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning. Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 5 tablets; Submitted to BMVC2025</p></details> |

We show that Hyformer is simultaneously optimized for molecule generation and property prediction, while exhibiting synergistic benefits in conditional sampling, out-of-distribution property prediction and representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of joint learning in a drug design use case of discovering novel antimicrobial~peptides.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS- to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multimodal Classification and Out-of-distribution Detection for Multimodal Intent Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12453v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal intent understanding is a significant research area that requires effective leveraging of multiple modalities to analyze human language. Existing methods face two main challenges in this domain. Firstly, they have limitations in capturing the nuanced and high-level semantics underlying complex in-distribution (ID) multimodal intents. Secondly, they exhibit poor generalization when confronted with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) data in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for both ID classification and OOD detection (MIntOOD). We first introduce a weighted feature fusion network that models multimodal representations. This network dynamically learns the importance of each modality, adapting to multimodal contexts. To develop discriminative representations for both tasks, we synthesize pseudo-OOD data from convex combinations of ID data and engage in multimodal representation learning from both coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives. The coarse-grained perspective focuses on distinguishing between ID and OOD binary classes, while the fine-grained perspective not only enhances the discrimination between different ID classes but also captures instance-level interactions between ID and OOD samples, promoting proximity among similar instances and separation from dissimilar ones. We establish baselines for three multimodal intent datasets and build an OOD benchmark. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves OOD detection performance with a 3~10% increase in AUROC scores while achieving new state-of-the-art results in ID classification.

The objective of sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements, application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Invariant Representation Learning by Distribution Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16126v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM), highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaSER: How Learning Can Guide the Evolution of Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17309v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolution and learning are two distinct yet complementary forms of adaptation. While evolutionary processes operate across generations via the selection of genotypes, learning occurs within the lifetime of an individual, shaping behavior through phenotypic adjustment. The Baldwin effect describes how lifetime learning can improve evolutionary search without altering inherited structures. While this has proven effective in areas like neuroevolution, where gradient-based learning is often used to fine-tune weights or behaviors produced by evolution, it remains underexplored in systems that evolve non-differentiable symbolic structures like Genetic Programming (GP). GP evolves explicit syntax trees that represent equations, offering strong interpretability but limited generalization due to the burden of discovering both useful representations and precise mappings. Here, we show for the first time that integrating a simple form of supervised learning, applied at the semantic or behavioral level during evaluation, can effectively guide the evolution of equations in GP. To achieve this, we propose a new GP pipeline, LaSER (Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression), where each GP individual generates a semantic representation that is passed to a supervised learner. The quality of the learned mapping is used to assign fitness, without modifying the underlying syntax tree or evolutionary process. Across standard symbolic regression benchmarks, in terms of generalization ability, LaSER significantly outperforms traditional GP and, in several cases, matches or exceeds popular machine learning regressors, while preserving the symbolic interpretability. By separating evolution from learning, LaSER offers a practical route to integrating GP with modern ML workflows, and opens new avenues for research at the intersection of evolutionary computation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on diverse datasets, including image data, we demonstrate that the proposed framework produces high-quality geodesics passing through the data support, reliably estimates the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold, and provides a global chart of the manifold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable framework for extracting the complete geometry of the data manifold.</p></details> |  |
| **[Next Token Perception Score: Analytical Assessment of your LLM Perception Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17169v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However, linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the (mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing LLM perception skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Discrepancy Bridging Method for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16756v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a critical role in geographic information interpretation, disaster monitoring, and urban planning by establishing semantic associations between image and textual descriptions. Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) models typically adopt symmetric adapter structures for exploring cross-modal correlations. However, the strong discriminative nature of text modality may dominate the optimization process and inhibits image representation learning. The nonnegligible imbalanced cross-modal optimization remains a bottleneck to enhancing the model performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a Representation Discrepancy Bridging (RDB) method for the RSITR task. On the one hand, a Cross-Modal Asymmetric Adapter (CMAA) is designed to enable modality-specific optimization and improve feature alignment. The CMAA comprises a Visual Enhancement Adapter (VEA) and a Text Semantic Adapter (TSA). VEA mines fine-grained image features by Differential Attention (DA) mechanism, while TSA identifies key textual semantics through Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism. On the other hand, this study extends the traditional single-task retrieval framework to a dual-task optimization framework and develops a Dual-Task Consistency Loss (DTCL). The DTCL improves cross-modal alignment robustness through an adaptive weighted combination of cross-modal, classification, and exponential moving average consistency constraints. Experiments on RSICD and RSITMD datasets show that the proposed RDB method achieves a 6%-11% improvement in mR metrics compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods and a 1.15%-2% improvement over the full fine-tuned GeoRSCLIP model.</p></details> |  |

This not only increases computational complexity but also fails to fully exploit shared features between geometry and attributes. To address this limitation, we propose SEDD-PCC, an end-to-end learning-based framework for lossy point cloud compression that jointly compresses geometry and attributes. SEDD-PCC employs a single encoder to extract shared geometric and attribute features into a unified latent space, followed by dual specialized decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and attributes. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge distillation to enhance feature representation learning from a teacher model, further improving coding efficiency.

| **[A Novel Generative Model with Causality Constraint for Mitigating Biases in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16708v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting counterfactual user feedback is essential for building effective recommender systems. However, latent confounding bias can obscure the true causal relationship between user feedback and item exposure, ultimately degrading recommendation performance. Existing causal debiasing approaches often rely on strong assumptions-such as the availability of instrumental variables (IVs) or strong correlations between latent confounders and proxy variables-that are rarely satisfied in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework called Latent Causality Constraints for Debiasing representation learning in Recommender Systems (LCDR). Specifically, LCDR leverages an identifiable Variational Autoencoder (iVAE) as a causal constraint to align the latent representations learned by a standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) through a unified loss function. This alignment allows the model to leverage even weak or noisy proxy variables to recover latent confounders effectively. The resulting representations are then used to improve recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LCDR consistently outperforms existing methods in both mitigating bias and improving recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While collaborative learning approaches such as federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData, interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge properties derived from its database schema and data distribution. WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected tabular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neighbour-Driven Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders for Scalable Structured Latent Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16481v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Variational Propagation: Local, Scalable and Efficient Alternative to Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05181v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, the additional label information does not always contribute positively to the GCN. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which allows the additional label information to positively influence the predictions of GCN. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[OCSU: Optical Chemical Structure Understanding for Molecule-centric Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15415v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the chemical structure from a graphical representation of a molecule is a challenging image caption task that would greatly benefit molecule-centric scientific discovery. Variations in molecular images and caption subtasks pose a significant challenge in both image representation learning and task modeling. Yet, existing methods only focus on a specific caption task that translates a molecular image into its graph structure, i.e., OCSR. In this paper, we propose the Optical Chemical Structure Understanding (OCSU) task, which extends low-level recognition to multilevel understanding and aims to translate chemical structure diagrams into readable strings for both machine and chemist. To facilitate the development of OCSU technology, we explore both OCSR-based and OCSR-free paradigms. We propose DoubleCheck to enhance OCSR performance via attentive feature enhancement for local ambiguous atoms. It can be cascaded with existing SMILES-based molecule understanding methods to achieve OCSU. Meanwhile, Mol-VL is a vision-language model end-to-end optimized for OCSU. We also construct Vis-CheBI20, the first large-scale OCSU dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the proposed approaches excel at providing chemist-readable caption for chemical structure diagrams, which provide solid baselines for further research. Our code, model, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/PharMolix/OCSU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Hierarchical Representation Learning of Samples and Features via Informed Tree-Wasserstein Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03627v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data often exhibit hierarchical structures in both modes: samples and features. Yet, most existing approaches for hierarchical representation learning consider only one mode at a time. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for jointly learning hierarchical representations of samples and features via Tree-Wasserstein Distance (TWD). Our method alternates between the two data modes. It first constructs a tree for one mode, then computes a TWD for the other mode based on that tree, and finally uses the resulting TWD to build the second mode's tree. By repeatedly alternating through these steps, the method gradually refines both trees and the corresponding TWDs, capturing meaningful hierarchical representations of the data. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our method converges. We show that our method can be integrated into hyperbolic graph convolutional networks as a pre-processing technique, improving performance in link prediction and node classification tasks. In addition, our method outperforms baselines in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning tasks on word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Search and Recommendation: A Generative Paradigm Inspired by Information Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process. To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Deep Representation Learning via Layerwise Feature Compression and Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02960v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers. In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Heimine/PNC_DLN.</p></details> | 65 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Oral...</summary><p>(Oral) CVPR 2025 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability for Vision.

However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral representations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case study, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select better source languages for crosslingual transfer. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/cisnlp/LangSAMP.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Transcriptomics provides interpretable, gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene expression representations with morphological information. To address data scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal representations for complex biological tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Proceedings</p></details> |

Recent multimodal learning methods, based on the multimodal information bottleneck (MIB) principle, aim to generate optimal MIB with maximal task-relevant information and minimal superfluous information via regularization. However, these methods often set ad hoc regularization weights and overlook imbalanced task-relevant information across modalities, limiting their ability to achieve optimal MIB. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework, Optimal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (OMIB), whose optimization objective guarantees the achievability of optimal MIB by setting the regularization weight within a theoretically derived bound. OMIB further addresses imbalanced task-relevant information by dynamically adjusting regularization weights per modality, promoting the inclusion of all task-relevant information. Moreover, we establish a solid information-theoretical foundation for OMIB's optimization and implement it under the variational approximation framework for computational efficiency. Finally, we empirically validate the OMIB's theoretical properties on synthetic data and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art benchmark methods in various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study examines the correlation between audio and text representations across transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across different layers and different tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, most current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon, named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity, and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Gating Mechanism in Sparse MoE: Handling Arbitrary Modality Inputs with Confidence-Guided Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19525v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively managing missing modalities is a fundamental challenge in real-world multimodal learning scenarios, where data incompleteness often results from systematic collection errors or sensor failures. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have the potential to naturally handle multimodal data, with individual experts specializing in different modalities. However, existing SMoE approach often lacks proper ability to handle missing modality, leading to performance degradation and poor generalization in real-world applications. We propose Conf-SMoE to introduce a two-stage imputation module to handle the missing modality problem for the SMoE architecture and reveal the insight of expert collapse from theoretical analysis with strong empirical evidence. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, Conf-SMoE propose a novel expert gating mechanism by detaching the softmax routing score to task confidence score w.r.t ground truth. This naturally relieves expert collapse without introducing additional load balance loss function. We show that the insights of expert collapse aligns with other gating mechanism such as Gaussian and Laplacian gate. We also evaluate the proposed method on four different real world dataset with three different experiment settings to conduct comprehensive the analysis of Conf-SMoE on modality fusion and resistance to missing modality.</p></details> |  |

However, vanilla fusion methods are limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level. First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way. Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios.

However, most current methods rely on proprietary datasets and evaluation rubrics, making fair comparisons between different approaches challenging. Moreover, these methods often employ evaluation metrics that capture only a subset of the desired properties of designed proteins, lacking a comprehensive assessment framework. To address these, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating de novo protein design from function. PDFBench supports two tasks: description-guided design and keyword-guided design. To ensure fair and multifaceted evaluation, we compile 22 metrics covering sequence plausibility, structural fidelity, and language-protein alignment, along with measures of novelty and diversity. We evaluate five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses across tasks. Finally, we analyze inter-metric correlations, exploring the relationships between four categories of metrics, and offering guidelines for metric selection. PDFBench establishes a unified framework to drive future advances in function-driven de novo protein design.</p></details> |  |

However, modalities collected and curated during development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Online Federated Learning with Modality Missing in Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16138v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1% run-time.

Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

While foundation models have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs, unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal, task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology, we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment, heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research in this rapidly evolving field.

| **[Spiking Neural Networks with Temporal Attention-Guided Adaptive Fusion for imbalanced Multi-modal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14535v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion (TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning, mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D, AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%, 70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing and efficient machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-granular body modeling with Redundancy-Free Spatiotemporal Fusion for Text-Driven Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06897v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-motion generation sits at the intersection of multimodal learning and computer graphics and is gaining momentum because it can simplify content creation for games, animation, robotics and virtual reality. Most current methods stack spatial and temporal features in a straightforward way, which adds redundancy and still misses subtle joint-level cues. We introduce HiSTF Mamba, a framework with three parts: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba and a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). The Dual-Spatial module runs part-based and whole-body models in parallel, capturing both overall coordination and fine-grained joint motion. The Bi-Temporal module scans sequences forward and backward to encode short-term details and long-term dependencies. DSFM removes redundant temporal information, extracts complementary cues and fuses them with spatial features to build a richer spatiotemporal representation. Experiments on the HumanML3D benchmark show that HiSTF Mamba performs well across several metrics, achieving high fidelity and tight semantic alignment between text and motion.</p></details> | 15pages,5figures, |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.</p></details> |  |

However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas, physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather than distinctly different physical insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Spotlight Paper at CVPR 2025 for MM4Mat</p></details> |

Although recent advances have improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering (JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts. Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers. We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figure |

In these scenarios, some samples may exhibit high similarity, yet they convey different semantics, making traditional distance metrics inadequate for distinguishing between positive and negative samples. This paper introduces geodesic distance as a novel distance metric in multi-modal learning for the first time, to mine correlations between samples, aiming to address the limitations of common distance metric. Our approach incorporates a comprehensive series of strategies to adapt geodesic distance for the current multimodal learning. Specifically, we construct a graph structure to represent the adjacency relationships among samples by thresholding distances between them and then apply the shortest-path algorithm to obtain geodesic distance within this graph. To facilitate efficient computation, we further propose a hierarchical graph structure through clustering and combined with incremental update strategies for dynamic status updates. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its capability to capture complex relationships between samples and improve the performance of multimodal learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

A key challenge is unimodal bias, where multimodal segmentors over rely on certain modalities, causing performance drops when others are missing, common in real world applications. To this end, we develop the first framework for learning robust segmentor that can handle any combinations of visual modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a parallel multimodal learning strategy for learning a strong teacher. The cross-modal and unimodal distillation is then achieved in the multi scale representation space by transferring the feature level knowledge from multimodal to anymodal segmentors, aiming at addressing the unimodal bias and avoiding over-reliance on specific modalities. Moreover, a prediction level modality agnostic semantic distillation is proposed to achieve semantic knowledge transferring for segmentation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-sensor benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Incorporating brain-inspired mechanisms for multimodal learning in artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10176v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, opening new frontiers in chemical understanding and drug discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML), a specifically designed approach to enhance molecular understanding and accelerate advancements in drug discovery. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder with 5 layers, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet and Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC). Ultimately, ACML exemplifies its potential to revolutionize molecular representational learning, offering deeper insights into the chemical semantics of diverse modalities and paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in chemical research and drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 19 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches assume the availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.</p></details> |  |

In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

This raises the question of whether we can relax or bypass the DAG assumption while maintaining practical utility. In this work, we propose a novel latent partial causal model for multimodal data, featuring two latent coupled variables, connected by an undirected edge, to represent the transfer of knowledge across modalities. Under specific statistical assumptions, we establish an identifiability result, demonstrating that representations learned by multimodal contrastive learning correspond to the latent coupled variables up to a trivial transformation. This result deepens our understanding of the why multimodal contrastive learning works, highlights its potential for disentanglement, and expands the utility of pre-trained models like CLIP. Synthetic experiments confirm the robustness of our findings, even when the assumptions are partially violated. Most importantly, experiments on a pre-trained CLIP model embodies disentangled representations, enabling few-shot learning and improving domain generalization across diverse real-world datasets. Together, these contributions push the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning, both theoretically and, crucially, in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets.

In this contribution, we identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 14pages |

Although recent alternatives such as SigLIP have begun to challenge this status quo, to our knowledge none are fully open: their training data remains proprietary and/or their training recipes are not released. This paper fills this gap with OpenVision, a fully-open, cost-effective family of vision encoders that match or surpass the performance of OpenAI's CLIP when integrated into multimodal frameworks like LLaVA. OpenVision builds on existing works -- e.g., CLIPS for training framework and Recap-DataComp-1B for training data -- while revealing multiple key insights in enhancing encoder quality and showcasing practical benefits in advancing multimodal models. By releasing vision encoders spanning from 5.9M to 632.1M parameters, OpenVision offers practitioners a flexible trade-off between capacity and efficiency in building multimodal models: larger models deliver enhanced multimodal performance, while smaller versions enable lightweight, edge-ready multimodal deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features.

| **[The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Aggregation of Dependent Expert Distributions in Multimodal Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01134v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Platonic Grounding for Efficient Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19327v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability. At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this, we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute. Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger systems efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets. The implementation details and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Wenyuzhy/DeepSPG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMR 2025 Main track.

| **[A multi-scale vision transformer-based multimodal GeoAI model for mapping Arctic permafrost thaw](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17822v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw. However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion, feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies, providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost landforms and their environmental implications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAP: Isolating Content from Style through Contrastive Learning with Augmented Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16445v6)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have garnered considerable attention for various downstream tasks, mainly due to the remarkable ability of the learned features for generalization. However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGA: Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation for Visible-to-Thermal Domain Adaptation across Multi-View Drone and Ground-Based Vision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15728v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-adaptive thermal object detection plays a key role in facilitating visible (RGB)-to-thermal (IR) adaptation by reducing the need for co-registered image pairs and minimizing reliance on large annotated IR datasets. However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/airliisc/IndraEye.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR-W PBVS 2025</p></details> |

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |
| **[IoT-AMLHP: Aligned Multimodal Learning of Header-Payload Representations for Resource-Efficient Malicious IoT Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14833v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification is crucial for securing Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for Video Saliency Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14267v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video saliency prediction is crucial for downstream applications, such as video compression and human-computer interaction. With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep. Experimental results show that TAVDiff outperforms existing methods, improving 1.03\%, 2.35\%, 2.71\% and 0.33\% on SIM, CC, NSS and AUC-J metrics, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEFT A2Z: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Survey for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14117v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, powering applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, fully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive computational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting large models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of parameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques, focusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin by analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic forgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy of PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid, and unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and trade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss important open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and suggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and theoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT and its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of large models.</p></details> | PEFT Survey paper |

Enhancing Multimodal Pretraining with Missing Modalities through Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13465v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Tabular Data: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16109v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

By enabling more intuitive interaction experiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to the music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music contributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers seeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and images, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily interacts with humans through auditory perception, making its data representation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first introduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music datasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music and multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions, music-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal interactions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of relevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation metrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark references for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in cross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |

Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MMCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, most FL systems assume clients hold only unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions often possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further constrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA, a novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized local model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to learn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data heterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that works effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose multimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ contrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure the independence between aligned features and context features within each modality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature fusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental results show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in multimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Concept Modality Specific Datasets (CMSDs), which consist of data subsets categorized by the modality (visual, textual, or audio) of annotated concepts. Models trained on CMSDs outperform those using traditional legacy training in both early and late fusion approaches. Notably, this approach enables late fusion models to achieve performance close to that of early fusion models. These findings underscore the importance of modality-specific annotations in developing robust, self-explainable video models and contribute to advancing interpretable multimodal learning in complex video analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 Figures |

Manual annotation of such transitions is labor-intensive and error-prone, while heuristic-based methods often fail to generalize across diverse video styles. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based approach that formulates the problem as a sequence-to-sequence classification task, where each second of a video is labeled as either "intro" or "film." Our method extracts frames at a fixed rate of 1 FPS, encodes them using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and processes the resulting feature representations with a multihead attention model incorporating learned positional encoding. The system achieves an F1-score of 91.0%, Precision of 89.0%, and Recall of 97.0% on the test set, and is optimized for real-time inference, achieving 11.5 FPS on CPU and 107 FPS on high-end GPUs. This approach has practical applications in automated content indexing, highlight detection, and video summarization. Future work will explore multimodal learning, incorporating audio features and subtitles to further enhance detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, submitted as a preprint.

In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, In Press by a journal</p></details> |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> |
| **[FluentLip: A Phonemes-Based Two-stage Approach for Audio-Driven Lip Synthesis with Optical Flow Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04427v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consecutive images of lip movements that align with a given speech in audio-driven lip synthesis is a challenging task. While previous studies have made strides in synchronization and visual quality, lip intelligibility and video fluency remain persistent challenges. This work proposes FluentLip, a two-stage approach for audio-driven lip synthesis, incorporating three featured strategies. To improve lip synchronization and intelligibility, we integrate a phoneme extractor and encoder to generate a fusion of audio and phoneme information for multimodal learning. Additionally, we employ optical flow consistency loss to ensure natural transitions between image frames. Furthermore, we incorporate a diffusion chain during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve both stability and efficiency. We evaluate our proposed FluentLip through extensive experiments, comparing it with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across five metrics, including a proposed metric called Phoneme Error Rate (PER) that evaluates lip pose intelligibility and video fluency. The experimental results demonstrate that our FluentLip approach is highly competitive, achieving significant improvements in smoothness and naturalness. In particular, it outperforms these SOTA approaches by approximately $\textbf{16.3%}$ in Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and $\textbf{35.2%}$ in PER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern drug pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing minority and semantically similar emotions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Oral |

While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19311v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning.

| **[Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18595v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/InfoReg_CVPR2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 16 figures, CVPR2025</p></details> |

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, traditional mapping methods are labor-intensive, limiting spatial coverage and introducing potential biases. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthScape, a novel, AI-ready multimodal dataset specifically designed for surficial geologic mapping and Earth surface analysis. EarthScape integrates high-resolution aerial RGB and near-infrared (NIR) imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), multi-scale DEM-derived terrain features, and hydrologic and infrastructure vector data.

| **[Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning for Bridging Modality Gaps in Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14938v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification (FS-RSSC) presents the challenge of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Optimal Transport Adapter Tuning (OTAT) framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for advancing multimodal learning in remote sensing applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in FS-RSSC, significantly improving the model performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Welding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16537v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the performance of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in skilled production work, with a focus on welding. Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV \& Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability. The study opens avenues for further research into multimodal learning in industry applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Multimodal Foundation Models for Material Property Prediction and Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00111v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, FL faces significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions, which can lead to suboptimal global models that fail to generalize across diverse clients. In this work, we propose a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by introducing a dual-adapter approach. The method utilizes a larger local adapter for client-specific personalization and a smaller global adapter to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing across clients. Additionally, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce communication overhead by selectively removing less impactful parameters from the local adapter. Through extensive experiments on a range of vision and language tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. It achieves higher test accuracy, lower performance variance among clients, and improved worst-case performance, all while significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Overall, the proposed method addresses the critical trade-off between model personalization and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid 2025</p></details> |

The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications. The dataset is available at https: //github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CDDMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024 (14 pages, 8 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalization of Tactile Image Generation: Reference-Free Evaluation in a Leakage-Free Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06860v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing, which relies on direct physical contact, is critical for human perception and underpins applications in computer vision, robotics, and multimodal learning. Because tactile data is often scarce and costly to acquire, generating synthetic tactile images provides a scalable solution to augment real-world measurements. However, ensuring robust generalization in synthesizing tactile images-capturing subtle, material-specific contact features-remains challenging. We demonstrate that overlapping training and test samples in commonly used datasets inflate performance metrics, obscuring the true generalizability of tactile models. To address this, we propose a leakage-free evaluation protocol coupled with novel, reference-free metrics-TMMD, I-TMMD, CI-TMMD, and D-TMMD-tailored for tactile generation. Moreover, we propose a vision-to-touch generation method that leverages text as an intermediate modality by incorporating concise, material-specific descriptions during training to better capture essential tactile features. Experiments on two popular visuo-tactile datasets, Touch and Go and HCT, show that our approach achieves superior performance and enhanced generalization in a leakage-free setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17823v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 10 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |
| **[DoPTA: Improving Document Layout Analysis using Patch-Text Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12902v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of multimodal learning has brought a significant improvement in document AI. Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating both textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in this space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as auxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based techniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text as input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning procedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique specially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to improve performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained with this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document image understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined with an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms larger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA also sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging document visual analysis benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GazeCLIP: Enhancing Gaze Estimation Through Text-Guided Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00260v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual gaze estimation, with its wide-ranging application scenarios, has garnered increasing attention within the research community. Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks. The implementation code and the pre-trained model will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

| **[BackdoorMBTI: A Backdoor Learning Multimodal Benchmark Tool Kit for Backdoor Defense Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11006v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented significant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert backdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

| **[MMBind: Unleashing the Potential of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data for Multimodal Learning in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12126v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sensing systems are increasingly prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new data binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We also propose a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data, coupled with an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying degrees of data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications\footnote (The source code is available via https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rebalanced Multimodal Learning with Data-aware Unimodal Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03792v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the modality learning degeneration caused by modality imbalance, existing multimodal learning~(MML) approaches primarily attempt to balance the optimization process of each modality from the perspective of model learning. However, almost all existing methods ignore the modality imbalance caused by unimodal data sampling, i.e., equal unimodal data sampling often results in discrepancies in informational content, leading to modality imbalance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel MML approach called \underline{D}ata-aware \underline{U}nimodal \underline{S}ampling~(\method), which aims to dynamically alleviate the modality imbalance caused by sampling. Specifically, we first propose a novel cumulative modality discrepancy to monitor the multimodal learning process. Based on the learning status, we propose a heuristic and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based data-aware unimodal sampling approaches to adaptively determine the quantity of sampled data at each iteration, thus alleviating the modality imbalance from the perspective of sampling. Meanwhile, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into almost all existing multimodal learning approaches as a plugin. Experiments demonstrate that \method~can achieve the best performance by comparing with diverse state-of-the-art~(SOTA) baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization via Self-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05933v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models. Our code will be released after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
